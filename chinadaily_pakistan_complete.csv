At a handover ceremony held by the China National Space Administration at its Beijing headquarters, the CNSA delivered payloads to governmental departments and officials, including authorities from the provinces of Hainan and Anhui and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. It also handed over payloads to foreign officials from countries such as Thailand and Pakistan. Meanwhile, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the nation's leading space contractor and the satellite's maker, delivered commercial goods to domestic enterprises. The articles delivered on Thursday arrived after a 13.5-day flight with Shijian 19, the first Chinese recoverable satellite that can be reused. Previously, China had launched nearly 30 recoverable satellites, but none of them could be reused. Developed by the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing, Shijian 19 was taken into space by a Long March 2D carrier rocket that lifted off on Sept 27 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. It was tasked with servicing space-based mutation breeding programs and carrying out flight tests for the research of domestically developed materials and electronic components. There were 20 categories of payloads flown with the satellite, including plant seeds, microorganism samples, technology demonstration devices, space experimental instruments and cultural items. The spacecraft returned to Earth on Oct 11 and was recovered at its predetermined landing site in Inner Mongolia. Bian Zhigang, deputy head of the space administration, said at the ceremony that breeding experiments of about 1,000 species of germplasm resources were conducted aboard Shijian 19, providing crucial support for the innovation of germplasm resources in China. The mission also offered a valuable in-orbit validation opportunity for domestically produced components and raw materials, he noted. Zhao Huiguang, a senior researcher with China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, said after the ceremony that the satellite's designers developed new equipment for it to better withstand extreme heat during atmospheric reentry and to mitigate the landing impact. He said reusable satellites enable scientists to carry out demanding, time-sensitive experiments in orbit. ""There are high levels of microgravity inside the spacecraft that are perfect for experiments requiring such conditions,"" he said. ""In addition, a reusable satellite promises the rapid return of experimental samples to scientists as they conduct time-sensitive studies."" The researcher noted that Shijian 19 is characterized by its good operational efficiency, as it is able to take a lot of payloads into space and then bring them back. Zhao said engineers will soon start checking the satellite's condition and replacing some equipment if needed. ""The satellite has been designed to be used at least 10 times. It usually takes about six months for it to get ready for a flight, but normally the payloads will need more time for ground preparation,"" he said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/25/671aef5ca310f1268d837aae.jpeg'],"['China\'s first reusable satellite returns to Earth with payloads on Oct 11, 2024.

Muhammad Shahbaz [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]  I had a flight from Shanghai Pudong International Airport to Sydney, and I went from Jinan to Shanghai by train. I arrived at 12:00 noon, and my flight was at 7:45 pm. I was thinking if I took the subway, it might take 40 minutes from the railway station to the airport. I bought the ticket and went inside the Maglev train. Many foreigners were taking photos of the train, and up she comes. I entered and sat. It started and within two minutes, the speed was shown on the screen: 301km/h. I was stunned. After 8 minutes it stopped and there was an announcement: "" Fei ji chang dao le "" (we have arrived at our destination, the airport). Besides, after coming to china, I came to know that I can shop online. When it comes to online shopping, no one can compete with Taobao. You sit in your room and order something, and then it arrives at your doorstepthe craze is unstoppable. 58.com, ganji.com are other good examples. 2) There were tears in my eyes, as the young girl told my professor, "" Wo tong guo le "" (I passed the exam). One month ago, Sir Niu Jun told the patient, ""you can appear in Gaokao ,"" and it was the whole team of our General Surgery department headed by Professor Niu Jun celebrating the happiness that we successfully operated on the 17-year-old girl with the Thyroid cancer metastasized to lungs. Even surgeons in some famous hospitals said they could not do the operation, but she wanted to appear in the exam. The exam was on June 7th and she was admitted to our ward on May 15th. She had the option to come after exam or get operated at once. She opted to go for the operation, as the cancer could spread to other parts of body if she chose later. The surgery was done on May 20th successfully, and she was able to speak within a few days after the operation. She was discharged on May 27th, 10 days before the exam. 3) "" Bu dao chang cheng fei hao han "". "" Bu dao chang cheng fei hao han ."" The sentence means: one who fails to reach the Great Wall cannot be called a man. "" Du wan juan shu bu ru xing wan li lu ."" It means: traveling thousands of miles is better than reading thousands of books. After reading this saying, I planned to travel around the world and especially in China during my spare time. I cannot forget the 28-hour Beijing trip. On June 22nd, 2011, it was 3 am and I received a call, saying ""I have arrived"". The company bus driver was waiting for me and Misbah (my best friend) at the hotel gate. We were to set to see the flag raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square at exact 5 am, and then we set off for the Great Wall. We were there at 7 am and the tickets were ready. This company was good. It took 140 yuan for hotel to pick up us to Tiananmen Square, the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and one museum, and back to the railway station in the afternoon. We took so many photos and went around the main historical places of Beijing within 14 hours. 4) OK Airlines and Kunyu Mountain.  Muhammad Shahbaz [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] Almost 90% of Chinese people can speak some English, like OK, yes, no, hello, and bye-bye. I never imagined that there would be an airline company in the world with the name: OK airlines. I was surprised when I arrived at Shenyang Airport Terminal 1 and found out there was no airline by this name. I sensed a feeling of being cheated, but suddenly I found that there were airlines by the name OK Airlines at Terminal 2, as it was written on my E ticket. I took a sigh of relief and then I was more surprised to see the size of the plane: a 28-seat small jet, in which the business class was with back benchers. Haha. This plane flies from Shenyang via Dalian to Yantai.  Kunyu Mountain was also an unforgettable scene in my life. I climbed the mountain with my friend Liu D anhui in the afternoon for 4 hours and coming down after sunset with no bus. The last bus already left at 4, but the gatekeeper arranged a taxi. Thanks to him. 5)The first day in Urumqi. On February 12th, 2006, I was at Urumqi International Airport. I was wearing a shirt and a normal jacket, but coming out of the airport, I was surprised: the white cotton balls were falling from sky. I am from Sargodha, a city in Pakistan, Punjab Province, where if it is 0 degree Celsius, the school will have a special day holiday. It is a city where the temperature in summer touches 40 degree Celsius easily. As far as I know, it hasn\'t had snow fall in my city for one century. Coming to China and experiencing weather like this was unbelievable. Quickly I went in the airport, opened my luggage, took out 2 jackets and wore. I went to the hotel and went to sleep, but suddenly I got up hearing the fireworks outside everywhere. I asked the reception what was happening outside, she replied me in Chinese: "" Xin nian kuai le, Chun jie kuai le "" (Happy new year , Happy spring festival). This was my first word that I learned after "" ni hao "". After I came to Jinan, Shandong Magazine took my interview. The editor asked me a question which I still remember: Ali, what is your first impression of China? My answer was: cold. 6) Professor Liu Zhiyu and me in the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan. I was in my homeland there, and Secretary of the Minister of Education was welcoming the delegate with the bouquet. We stayed at the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and I was searching for the Pakistani food in Pakistan, but there was still Chinese food in the Chinese Consulate as there was a Chinese chef. After eating noodles, when all members of delegate went to their rooms, I silently went to the kitchen and asked the Chinese chef, saying ""elder brother, please help me make the Pakistani Paratha/naan and Chicken curry"". He nudged and took out a packet from the refrigerator, where there were ready-made parathas and chicken curry. I have already made a new Chinese friend. The next day, we went to the mausoleum of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan. We received guard of honor, the best memories of my life. I wrote comments in the mausoleum diary with my professor. I was given honor in my country because of the Chinese delegation; I will remember that for long time. My father presented a Pakistani Souvenir, Pagg, Pakistani turban to my professor Liu Zhiyu, saying ""Pak-Cheen Dosti Zindabad (in Urdu) Zhong ba you yi wan sui"" (China-Pak friendship last forever). 7) My first speech on September 26th, 2007  Muhammad Shahbaz [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] I always wanted to go to research field, but in Pakistan, it is a dream of the parents that their child became a doctor or an engineer. As there was no short cut to go directly to research, I chose MBBS degree on my parents' wish.  During my undergraduate studies, I started going to the lab in my extra time and published a research paper with the help of my professor in my 3rd year. I was in Shanghai with my professor then. It was on September 26th, 2007, the day on which I was to deliver my first presentation. My heart was beating up and I was feeling nervous. Professor Liu came to me and said, ""Ali, there is a long way in front of you, and the success follows the braveness."" I was confident. I went to stage and delivered my presentation. 2 years later in Sydney, Australia, I was more confident and I participated in a competition of young scientist speakers from 27 countries. I won the first prize. Sometimes people around the world may be thinking that I am a graduate of China, and someone even says, oh Made in China. I want to say that China gave me the strong base for my future. Even my home country did not give me the education and opportunity to be a doctor and the best young scientist speaker. After all, it depends upon the individual. If you cannot change yourself, no one can change you. We were having a dinner Last week, and my friend said let us 7 Shandong people and one foreigner cheers. ""Sir, I am not a foreigner but a Shandong person,"" I said. Everyone was laughing. Jinan is my second hometown. I love it, and I am proud to be a graduate of Shandong University. 8) Zhong Guo Tong.  Muhammad Shahbaz [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]  Most of my friends who know me and who meet me call me Zhong guo tong (China Expert), and even my favorite sport player after Inzmam ul Haq (cricket player) is Yao Ming (basketball player) and Liu Xiang (athlete). Although Liu Xiang did not win because of his injury, he is still very famous. I went to see him in the 2009 National Games held in Jinan, and I cannot forget my opera performance at the Inter-University Club show. I was wearing a red Chinese traditional opera dress and singing opera. It is an amazing experience. I went to visit a village near the Yellow River in winter, and I saw some farmers who were working on rice threshers. I went there and they took photos with me. Last summer, I went to Shaolin Temple in Zhengzhou province with my professor Niu Jun. We climbed to the top of the mountain and took many photos. It was the best experience of my life. At the base of the mountain, the children practicing Kongfu was something amazing. There is Lanzhou Lamian, a kind of famous noodle restaurant. We ate and started to learn cooking. After that, I tried to cook at home and many of my Pakistani classmates could not cook so. We taught Pakistani recipes to Chinese friend and she opened a Pakistani Chinese restaurant named Fatimai jiejie\'s Restaurant. She makes the samosa, which is made with some changes in dumpling recipes. Furthermore, I found out that there are two words same in Chinese and Urdu Language: ""da ye"" means elder uncle, and ""da yi"" means elder aunt. They have the same meaning and pronunciation in Urdu. If no one wants to listen to your song, you do not need to worry, because you can go to the KTV, where you can sing loudly and have a music party. During these years, I have visited many places of historic interest and scenic beauty in China, all these were unforgettable experiences in my life. I have 2 best friends, Gao Huijie and Liang Benjia. I cannot stop laughing when I think about our beautiful friendship. Sometimes people ask me, Do you like China? My answer is always the same. I don't like China but I love China. Dr.Muhammad Shahbaz (Ali) is a Master Degree student of General Surgery on CSC Scholarship at Shandong University School of Medicine.

Humanity at a Crossroads II. An Answer to the Call of the Times and a Blueprint for the Future III. Deep Roots in History and Cultural Traditions IV. Direction and Path V. China's Action and Contribution Conclusion Preface In the universe there is only one Earth, the shared home of humanity. Unfortunately, this planet on which we rely for our subsistence is facing immense and unprecedented crises, both known and unknown, both foreseeable and unforeseeable. Whether human civilization can survive these has become an existential issue that must be squarely faced. More and more people have come to the realization that rather than amassing material wealth, the most pressing task is to find a guiding beacon for the sustainable development of human civilization, because we all care about our future. Ten years ago President Xi Jinping propounded the idea of building a global community of shared future, answering a question raised by the world, by history, and by the times: ""Where is humanity headed?"" His proposal lights the path forward as the world fumbles for solutions, and represents China\'s contribution to global efforts to protect our shared home and create a better future of prosperity for all. To build a global community of shared future, all peoples, all countries, and all individuals  our destinies being interconnected  must stand together in adversity and through thick and thin, navigating towards greater harmony on this planet that we call home. We should endeavor to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity, turning people's longing for a better life into reality. The vision of a global community of shared future bears in mind the wellbeing of all humanity. It is based on both observation of the present and visionary planning for the future. It lays out goals, charts the path, and offers action plans to achieve them. It concerns the future of humanity and the destiny of every human being. President Xi Jinping first raised the vision of a global community of shared future when addressing the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 2013. Over the past decade it has been steadily enriched. He fleshed it out with a five-point proposal in his speech at the General Debate of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly in 2015. He further proposed five goals for the world in his speech at the United Nations Office in Geneva in 2017. This represents the steady increase in the depth and scope of the vision. The past decade has seen steady progress in implementing the vision. From bilateral to multilateral and from regional to global dimensions, ground-breaking results have been achieved on every front. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative have taken root and borne fruits, bringing prosperity and stability to the world and creating substantive benefits for the people. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world. It is now widely recognized in the international community that the vision has nothing to do with self-interest and protectionism. Instead, by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it confronts the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. It is therefore of great significance to promote solidarity and cooperation among all countries and create a better future for humanity. The Chinese government is publishing this white paper to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future. We hope it will improve understanding and expand consensus in the international community, and reinforce the global effort to realize this vision. I. Humanity at a Crossroads This is an era of promise, and an era of challenges. At yet another crossroads in history, we have to choose between unity and division, between opening up and closing off, between cooperation and confrontation. With the overall interests of humanity at stake, this choice tests the wisdom of all countries. 1. Interdependence is the prevailing trend throughout history In its history, humanity has progressed from primitive society to the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and now the Information Revolution. While this process has seen a steep increase in productivity, one fundamental reality has remained unchanged: The Earth is our one and only home. All countries bear responsibility for the safety of this planet and the future of humanity. If the pursuit of power and profit escalates to vicious competition or even armed conflict, self-destruction will be the certain outcome. Throughout history, peace and development have been the primary aspirations of humanity. Having experienced the ravages of wars and conflicts, especially the two world wars, people around the globe have built a keener awareness of cherishing peace, expanding cooperation, and seeking common development. The idea that ""we are all one human family"" is gaining traction, and the desire for a global community grows stronger than ever. Globalization has improved the allocation of production factors worldwide, including capital, information, technology, labor and management. As if connecting scattered lakes and creeks into an uninterrupted expanse of water, it draws nations out of isolation and away from the obsolete model of self-reliance, merging their individual markets into a global one and combining their respective experiences into world history. As information technology advances with every passing day, most prominently in the fields of Internet, big data, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, human exchanges have become deeper, broader, and more extensive than ever before, and countries are more interconnected and interdependent than at any point in the past. Globalization is not an option; it is the reality and the way of life. The global village is getting smaller  the longest distance between two places on earth has been reduced to a flight of no greater than 24 hours, and our planet is becoming flat  one tap on a mobile phone connects us to the other side of the world in a split second. This is an integrated world. Those who turn their back on it will have no place in it. Living on the same planet, all countries, adjacent or distant, large or small, developed or developing, are members of an emerging community of shared interests, responsibility, and destiny, whose wellbeing and security are interrelated. Only when appropriate attention is paid to the collective future of humanity is it possible that the wishes of every country, people and individual come true. Whatever we may encounter on our journey ahead, the only right choice is to work together for the benefit of all. 2. Global challenges call for global response Our world is undergoing change on a scale unseen in a century. Various problems old and new and complex issues are converging with and compounding each other, posing unprecedented challenges for human society. Instability, uncertainty, and unpredictability are now the norm. The peace deficit is growing. Though human society has largely maintained peace since the end of World War II, threats to world peace continue to amass. War has returned to the Eurasian continent, tensions are rising, and a series of flashpoints are emerging. The shadow of the arms race lingers on, and the threat of nuclear war  the Sword of Damocles that hangs over humanity  remains. Our world is at risk of plunging into confrontation and even war. The development deficit is ballooning. The global economic recovery is sluggish, and unilateralism and protectionism are rampant. Some countries are turning to a ""small yard, high fence"" approach to wall themselves off; they are pushing for decoupling, severing and ""derisking"" supply chains. All this has caused setbacks to globalization. At the same time the Covid-19 pandemic has reversed global development, exacerbating the North-South gap, development fault lines, and the technology divide. The Human Development Index has declined for the first time in 30 years. The world\'s poor population has increased by more than 100 million, and nearly 800 million people live in hunger. The security deficit is glaring. Due to more intense global strategic competition and a lack of mutual trust between major countries, the Cold War mindset has re-emerged, and calls for ideological confrontation have resurfaced. Some countries' hegemonic, abusive, and aggressive actions against others, in the form of swindling, plundering, oppression, and the zero-sum game, are causing great harm. Non-traditional security challenges are on the rise, including terrorism, cyber-attacks, transnational crime, and biological threats. The governance deficit is more severe. The world is facing multiple governance crises. The energy crisis, food crisis, and debt crisis are intensifying. Global climate governance is urgently needed, and the transition to green, low-carbon development requires dedicated efforts over an extended period of time. The digital divide continues to expand, and sound governance of artificial intelligence is lacking. The Covid-19 pandemic is a mirror through which we have observed that the global governance system is falling further behind the times and keeps breaking down on issues requiring resolution. It has to be reformed and improved. In the face of global crises, the 190-plus countries in the world are all in the same big boat. Only big boats can withstand battering winds and crashing waves. No country, however strong it may be, can do everything on its own. We must engage in global cooperation. Only when all countries work together, only when we align individual interests with the interests of all, and only when we truly build a global community of shared future, can humanity tide through the crises confronting us and sail towards a better future. 3. The new era calls for new ideas This is an era when the world is undergoing rapid changes almost every day. We can no longer interpret the reality we are living in or find satisfactory solutions to the conundrums we are facing by means of traditional approaches to international relations. It is increasingly obvious that the idea that ""all strong countries will seek hegemony"", the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times. Humanity is in great need of new ideas that generate positive developments and conform to positive historical trends. There is no iron law that dictates that a rising power will inevitably seek hegemony. This assumption represents typical hegemonic thinking and is grounded in memories of catastrophic wars between hegemonic powers in the past. China has never accepted that once a country becomes strong enough, it will invariably seek hegemony. China understands the lesson of history  that hegemony preludes decline. We pursue development and revitalization through our own efforts, rather than invasion or expansion. And everything we do is for the purpose of providing a better life for our people, all the while creating more development opportunities for the entire world, not in order to supersede or subjugate others. The strong preying on the weak is not a way for humans to coexist. If the law of the jungle is imposed on human society, and the idea that ""might makes right"" prevails, the principle of sovereign equality will be fundamentally undermined, and world peace and stability will be severely endangered. In the age of globalization, all countries are interdependent and interconnected. Therefore the law of the jungle and the winner-takes-all mindset will lead nowhere  inclusive development for the benefit of all is the right path forward. China has consistently championed equity and justice, and remains committed to friendly cooperation with other countries, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, in order to advance democracy in international relations. The zero-sum game in which one wins by causing others to lose is doomed to fail. Nevertheless, certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages. This will do nothing for their development over the long run; it will simply create a major threat to world peace and prosperity. No country should hope for others to fail. Instead, it should work together with other countries for the success of all. China consistently aligns its development with global development, and aligns the interests of the Chinese people with the common interests of all peoples around the world. When the world thrives, China thrives, and vice versa. II. An Answer to the Call of the Times and a Blueprint for the Future Standing at a crossroads, humanity is faced with two opposing options. One is to revert to the Cold War mentality that deepens division and antagonism and stokes confrontation between blocs. The other is to act for the common wellbeing of humanity, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, advocate openness and win-win results, and promote equality and respect. The tug of war between these two options will shape the future of humanity and our planet in a profound way. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and levels of development coming together to promote shared interests, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges, and draws a new blueprint for a better world. 1. Introducing a new approach to international relations The current international order is facing a myriad of challenges. Some countries, holding to the notion of might makes right, willfully engage in bullying, plundering and zero-sum competition. The development gap is widening and the deficit in security is growing. The isolationist and exclusive practice of alliance-based confrontation runs counter to the trend towards multipolarity and the evolution of international relations in the post-Cold War era. Especially with the rise of a large number of emerging market and developing countries, the current international order is increasingly out of step with the changing times. ""What kind of world we need and how to build such a world"" has become a vital question with the future of humanity at stake. China's answer to this question of the times is to build a global community of shared future. It means that with their futures closely interlocked, all nations and countries should stick together, share weal and woe, live together in harmony, and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. The idea is based on a reasonable design for state-to-state relations. It reflects the general consensus and common expectations of the international community, and demonstrates China's sense of duty as a responsible major country. In this global village, all human beings are one big family. With their interests intertwined and futures interlocked, countries are turning into a community of shared future. Such a vision rises above the exclusive rules of bloc politics, the notion of might makes right, and the ""universal values"" defined by a handful of Western countries. It conforms to the trend of the times, echoes the call for global cooperation, and contributes to a more just and equitable international order. 2. Highlighting the new features of global governance The concept of a global community of shared future holds that all countries share a common future, and envisions a world characterized by openness and inclusiveness, equity and justice, harmonious coexistence, diversity and mutual learning, and unity and cooperation.  Openness and inclusiveness. Countries should not draw lines based on ideology, target specific countries, or gang up to form exclusive blocs. The ocean is vast because it admits all rivers. To build a global community of shared future, countries should advance democracy in international relations to make sure that the future of the world is determined by all, that international rules are written by all, that global affairs are governed by all, and that the fruits of development are shared by all.  Equity and justice. The world needs justice, not hegemonism. No country has the right to dominate global affairs, dictate the future of others, or monopolize development advantages. Countries should safeguard the international order based on international law, uphold the authority of the international rule of law, and ensure equal and unified application of international law. The practice of double standards or selective application of law should be rejected.  Harmonious coexistence. Countries should strive to achieve peaceful coexistence and common development by seeking common ground while reserving differences. Planet Earth is not an arena for wrestling between countries, but a stage for human coexistence. Despite their differences and diverse features, countries can develop together in harmony and unity, and it is precisely such diversity that gives strength to global development.  Diversity and mutual learning. Different histories, national conditions, ethnic groups, and customs have given birth to diverse civilizations. Diversity of human civilizations is a basic feature of our world. Mutual learning among civilizations provides important impetus to human progress. Countries should respect one another and jointly pursue common development through exchanges and mutual learning.  Unity and cooperation. Countries should act for the greater good. Pursuing development behind closed doors can only result in poverty. Viewed from a ""country-first"" perspective, the world is small and crowded, and locked in ""fierce competition""; viewed from the perspective of a shared future, the world is vast, and full of opportunities for cooperation. No country can overcome global development challenges on its own. Cooperation among all countries is the only viable option. 3. Opening up new prospects for international exchanges China has made a five-point proposal for building a global community of shared future in the areas of partnerships, security environment, development, inter-civilization exchanges, and ecosystem. This has opened up new prospects for international exchanges. We should build partnerships in which countries treat each other as equals, engage in extensive consultation, and enhance mutual understanding. The principle of sovereign equality runs through the UN Charter. All countries are equals. The big, the mighty and the wealthy should not bully the small, the weak and the poor. We should uphold multilateralism and reject unilateralism. We should replace the outdated mindset of winner takes all with a new vision of seeking win-win outcomes for all. We should forge global partnerships at both international and regional levels, and embrace a new approach to state-to-state relations, one founded on dialogue rather than confrontation and that seeks partnership rather than alliance. In handling their relations, major countries should follow the principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation. Big countries should treat small countries as equals and take the right approach to friendship and interests, pursuing both friendship and interests and putting friendship first. We should create a security environment featuring fairness, justice, joint efforts, and shared interests. In the age of economic globalization, the security of all countries is interlinked, and each has an impact on the others. No country can maintain absolute security on its own, and no country can achieve stability by destabilizing others. The law of the jungle leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong; it is not the way for countries to conduct their relations. Those who choose to oppress will invite harm to themselves, like lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet. We should reject Cold War mentality in all its manifestation, and foster a new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should promote open, innovative and inclusive development that benefits all. Development is meaningful only when it is inclusive and sustainable. To achieve such development requires openness, mutual assistance and mutually beneficial relations. Long-term global development cannot be founded on one group of countries becoming increasingly prosperous while another group of countries remain chronically poor and backward. Development should be placed high on the international agenda, and efforts should be made to reduce inequality and imbalance in global development, leaving no country or individual behind. We should increase inter-civilization exchanges to promote harmony, inclusiveness, and respect for differences. There are more than 200 countries and regions, over 2,500 ethnic groups and a vast number of religions in our world. Such cultural diversity is what makes the world colorful. Diversity breeds exchanges, exchanges lead to integration, and integration brings progress. Only by upholding the equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness of civilizations, and working for mutual respect, experience sharing, and harmonious coexistence while preserving diversity, can the world maintain its diversity and thrive. We should respect all civilizations, treat each other as equals, and draw inspiration from each other to boost the creative development of human civilization. We should build an ecosystem that puts Mother Nature and green development first. Humanity may have the ability to utilize nature and even transform it, but it is still a part of nature. We should care for nature and not place ourselves above it. We should reconcile industrial development with nature, and pursue harmony between humanity and nature to achieve sustainable global development and all-round human development. We should respect nature, follow its ways, and protect it. We should firmly pursue green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. 4. Outlining a new vision for building a better world China proposes to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, common security, and common prosperity. From ""the five-point proposal"" to ""the five goals"", the concept of a global community of shared future has gained a broader historical perspective and deeper meaning, and set a clearer goal and drawn a clearer blueprint for the future of humanity. We should build a world of lasting peace through dialogue and consultation. It means beating the swords of war into the plowshares of peace. The stone wall at the entrance to the UNESCO headquarters carries the inscription of one single message: ""Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed."" Throughout human history, obsession with power and hegemony has led to frequent wars and loss of lives. The lessons are painful and profound, and we need to remove the fuses of war from our minds. Big countries should treat the smaller ones as equals instead of seeking unilateral dominance or imposing their will on others. No country should open Pandora\'s box by willfully provoking turmoil and armed conflict or undermining the international rule of law. Countries should respect each other\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect each other\'s core interests and major concerns, and respect the development path and social system chosen by other peoples. We should build a world of common security for all through joint efforts. It means turning absolute security for one into common security for all. There is no place in the world that enjoys absolute security, and a country cannot build its security on the turmoil of others. Threats to other countries can turn into a challenge to one's own country. When neighbors are in trouble, instead of reinforcing one's own fences, one should extend a helping hand. As challenges often take on global dimensions, it is all the more important for countries to cooperate in addressing them, turning pressure into motivation and crises into opportunities. Unilateral action or blind belief in the use of force cannot address the complex international security threats. The only solution lies in cooperative and common security. It is normal for countries to have differences, and they should be properly addressed through dialogue and consultation. As long as we show sincerity, goodwill and political wisdom, no conflict is too big to resolve and no ice is too thick to break. We should build a world of common prosperity through win-win cooperation. It means bidding farewell to the winner-takes-all mindset and sharing development achievements. In this day and age, the international community has evolved into a sophisticated and integrated apparatus, as the removal of any single part will cause serious problems to its overall operation. We must keep to the correct direction of economic globalization, and oppose any attempt to set up technological blockades, cause technological divides, or seek development decoupling. While we should make the pie of the global economy bigger, it is even more important to divide it well, so that development achievements can benefit people of all countries more equitably, and bring about true cooperation and win-win results. We should build an open and inclusive world through exchanges and mutual learning. It means bidding farewell to the mindset that one civilization is superior to another and starting to appreciate the strengths of other civilizations. Our world can fully accommodate the common growth and progress of all countries, and success for one country does not mean failure for another. There is no universally applicable development path. A development path that continuously benefits the people is the most viable one. Countries and nations should respect their differences and seek harmony without uniformity, and civilizations should draw strength from each other and make progress together. Exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations should be a driving force for human progress and a strong underpinning for world peace. We should make our world clean and beautiful by pursuing green and low-carbon development. It means bidding farewell to the destructive exploitation of resources and preserving and enjoying the lush mountains and lucid waters. Humanity coexists with nature. Any harm we inflict on nature will eventually come back to haunt us. We often take natural resources such as air, water, soil and blue sky for granted. But we could not survive without them. Industrialization has created a level of material wealth never seen before, but it has also inflicted irreparable damage on the environment. We must not exhaust all the resources passed on to us by previous generations and leave nothing to our children, or pursue development in a destructive way. Lush mountains and lucid waters are invaluable assets. We must follow the philosophy of harmony between humanity and nature and observance of the laws of nature and pursue a path of sustainable development, so that everyone is able to enjoy a starry sky, lush mountains and fragrant flowers. Building a global community of shared future is China's proposed strategy for reforming and improving the international governance system. This does not mean that the international system should be dismantled or started afresh. Rather, it means promoting greater democracy in international relations and making global governance more just and equitable. This important vision reflects the broadest common aspiration of the peoples of all countries in pursuit of peace, development, and stability, and the broadest consensus among countries with different cultural backgrounds and at different stages of development. It transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. III. Deep Roots in History and Cultural Traditions The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of the People's Republic of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations. It manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values. 1. Inheriting the best of traditional Chinese culture China's fine traditional culture epitomizes the essence of the Chinese civilization. It provides inspiring insights to help understand and shape the world and address current challenges, and contains elements of the vision of building a global community of shared future. Harmony is the core concept of Chinese culture, which values the primacy of harmony and harmony within diversity, pursues the ideal of harmony and solidarity towards common progress, and embraces cultural diversity and global harmony. The Chinese nation believes all nations together are one community, advocates fraternity among all peoples and peace for all countries, follows the principle of interstate relations that the strong do not bully the weak and the rich do not insult the poor, and pursues a world of fairness and justice for the common good. The Chinese nation champions universal benevolence, holding that the virtuous are never left to stand alone, endorsing good neighborliness with good faith and good will, and pursuing both friendship and interests while putting friendship first. The Chinese nation observes the rule that ""to establish oneself, one must help others to establish themselves first; to succeed, one must help others to succeed first"", believing that helping others is helping oneself. It also upholds the principle that ""do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself"", and never imposes its will upon other nations. The Chinese nation acts on the belief that humans are part of nature and follows the old adage: ""Fish with a line but not with a net; when fowling, do not aim at a roosting bird."" It reveres the laws of the universe, loves nature, and pursues harmony between humanity and nature. 2. Showcasing the global vision of the Communist Party of China Always championing a global vision is part of the valuable experience accumulated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in its century-long history. Over the past one hundred years and more, the CPC has always sought happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation while pursuing progress for all of humanity and the common good of the world. It succeeded in leading the Chinese people onto a distinctively Chinese path to modernization and developing a new form of human advancement. These successes have laid a solid foundation for building a global community of shared future, charting the course and opening up broad prospects for this great endeavor. The CPC is committed to seeking progress for China while benefiting the wider world, bringing a good life to the Chinese people and also helping other peoples to prosper, and contributing more to humanity. The report to the 20th CPC National Congress in 2022 drew a great blueprint for rejuvenating the Chinese nation on all fronts by pioneering a uniquely Chinese path to modernization, and pointed out that striving to build a global community of shared future is one of the intrinsic requirements of Chinese modernization, affirming the close bond between the future of China and the future of all humanity. The CPC leads the Chinese people in blazing and expanding China's path to modernization based on both China's distinctive conditions and other countries' common approaches. Chinese modernization is the modernization of common prosperity for a huge population, coordinated material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development. All these features have provided useful experience for other developing countries and a more robust and sustainable option for jointly building a global community of shared future. 3. Promoting the fine diplomatic traditions of New China Over the past 70 years and more, China has made notable progress, established fine traditions, and forged a tenacious character and unique strengths in developing foreign relations. The initiative of building a global community of shared future builds on the PRC's diplomatic philosophies, strategic thinking and traditions, and opens up new horizons for major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. After the PRC was founded in 1949, China committed itself to an independent foreign policy of peace and put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the Three Worlds theory and other principles, policies and ideas. This allowed China to find its place, win respect, and expand its reach in the international community. After the launch of reform and opening up in 1978, China asserted that peace and development are the underlying trends of the times. It advocated multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations, promoted a harmonious world, and achieved significant progress in China's diplomacy around the world. In the new era, championing peace, development, and win-win cooperation, China has advanced its major-country diplomacy on all fronts and formed a multifaceted, multilevel, and all-dimensional diplomatic strategy. China has initiated a range of visionary initiatives, including a global community of shared future, a new type of international relations, the common values of humanity, the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and promoted a set of approaches to global governance, to friendship and interests, to security, to development, to cooperation, and to the eco-environment. All these carry distinctively Chinese features, style and ethos. 4. Incorporating the outstanding achievements of other civilizations The concept of a global community of shared future incorporates the best of the cultures of enduring appeal and impact that have transcended time, space, and national borders in human history. It crystallizes the shared values of people from different regions, cultures, ethnic backgrounds and with different religious beliefs. It draws on the outstanding achievements of cultural integration between diverse civilizations. It embodies the common aspiration of all humanity. All civilizations around the world have manifestations of the concept of a global community of shared future. Ancient Greek philosophers conducted primary research on this concept based on city-states, believing that humanity as one community should act in concert to pursue common interests and thus must live in harmony. Ancient Indian literature records the motto of ""Under Heaven  one family"". The African philosophy of Ubuntu holds that ""I am because we are,"" emphasizing interdependence of humanity. The concept of a global community of shared future reflects the common interests of all civilizations  peace, development, unity, coexistence, and win-win cooperation. A Russian proverb holds, ""Together we can weather the storm."" The Swiss-German writer Hermann Hesse proposed, ""Serve not war and destruction, but peace and reconciliation."" A German proverb reads, ""An individual\'s effort is addition; a team\'s effort is multiplication."" An African proverb states, ""One single pillar is not sufficient to build a house."" An Arabian proverb asserts, ""If you want to walk fast, walk alone; if you want to walk far, walk together."" Mexican poet Alfonso Reyes wrote, ""The only way to be profitably national is to be generously universal."" An Indonesian proverb says, ""Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps."" A Mongolian proverb concludes, ""Neighbors are connected at heart and share a common destiny."" All the above narratives manifest the profound cultural and intellectual essence of the world. In building a global community of shared future, all countries should observe the widely acknowledged norms of international relations. Since the advent of modern times, a fair and equitable international order has been the long-standing goal of all humanity. From the principle of equity and sovereignty established by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, to international humanitarianism established by the Geneva Conventions in 1864, then to the four purposes and seven principles established by the Charter of the United Nations in 1945, and later to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed at the Bandung Conference in 1955, these norms of international relations have evolved into widely recognized principles and become the essential foundations of a global community of shared future. IV. Direction and Path The vision of a global community of shared future is the outcome of China's wisdom in handling contemporary international relations from the perspective of world peace and development  a Chinese plan for improving global governance, and a Chinese proposal to address various challenges in the 21st century. Vision guides action and direction determines the future. The international community should work together to turn the grand blueprint into a road map, and a beautiful vision into reality step by step. 1. Pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization Economic globalization is an irreversible trend of global economic development, and is in line with the desire for development and cooperation held by people of all countries. Economic globalization has greatly facilitated trade, investment, flows of people, and technological advances, making an important contribution to global economic development. However, problems and drawbacks also accumulated in the process, and there are attempts at retreating from it. The current model of economic globalization fails to reflect the demands or represent the interests of developing countries. The law of the jungle, zero-sum game, and the ""win-or-lose"", ""winner-takes-all"" mindset have exacerbated the divide between the rich and the poor, as evidenced by the widening gap between developed and developing countries, and that within developed countries. Some countries blame their problems in domestic governance on economic globalization or other countries, and resort to unilateral, protectionist, and bullying actions. This has damaged global industrial, value, supply and consumption chains, and caused turbulence and even conflict in the current international trade order. Promoting a new type of economic globalization is essential for building a global community of shared future. Countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Countries should strive to build a system of fair, reasonable, and transparent international economic and trade rules, press ahead with trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and promote further global economic openness, exchange, and integration in order to form an economic globalization that is open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, so that people of all countries can share the fruits of economic globalization and world economic growth. Opening up should be a two-way journey, not a one-way street; one cannot demand the opening of other countries while closing its own doors. Some countries are seeking to decouple from and break chains with China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences"", which will ultimately only backfire on themselves. Some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""derisk"", which is essentially creating new risks. Risk prevention and cooperation are not mutually contradictory, whereas non-cooperation is the biggest risk and non-development is the biggest threat to security. Pursuing de-sinicization in the name of derisking and reducing dependence undermines opportunities, cooperation, stability, and development. The current revolution in science and technology marked by artificial intelligence will have a profound impact on the new round of economic globalization and social development. Relevant rules and standards should be established to support scientific and technological innovation and guard the red line of human security. The interests of all countries, especially developing ones, should be taken into account in a balanced manner, to ensure that technological innovation is placed under the rule of law and internationally recognized norms, and ensure that innovation is steered by and works for humanity, and is consistent with human values. 2. Following a peaceful development path History tells us that for a country to develop and prosper, it must understand and follow the trend of global development; otherwise it will be abandoned by history. The trend now is the pursuit of peace, development, cooperation, and win-win results. The old path of colonialism and hegemonism leads to a dead end and those who follow it will pay a heavy price, whereas the path of peaceful development is the right one for the world to follow. The pursuit of peace, amity and harmony is deeply rooted in the cultural realm of the Chinese nation and runs in the blood of the Chinese people. For a long time in the past, China was one of the most powerful countries in the world, but it does not have any record of colonization or aggression against other countries. China's adherence to the path of peaceful development is an extension of the millennia-old cultural tradition of the peace-loving Chinese nation. China always adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace and has always emphasized that the goal of China's foreign policy is to maintain world peace and promote common development. China opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. It will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion. These principles are stated in China's policies, incorporated in its systemic designs, and always adhered to in its practices. The world needs peace, just like a human being needs air and living things need sunshine. The path of peaceful development is beneficial to China and the world, and we cannot think of any reason not to stay on this path. China follows the path of peaceful development, and hopes that other countries will take this path as well. Only by working together to pursue peace, safeguard peace, and share peace can countries achieve their development goals and make greater contributions to the world. Only when everyone follows the path of peaceful development can countries coexist peacefully, and can there be hope for building a global community of shared future. 3. Fostering a new type of international relations The new type of international relations is different in that it has created a new path for interactions between countries, opened up a new chapter of world history where different civilizations and countries with different systems coexist in peace and seek common development, and paved the way for building a global community of shared future. A new type of international relations should be built on the principles of mutual respect, equity and justice, and mutually beneficial cooperation. Mutual respect means treating people with sincerity and equality, and opposing power politics and bullying practices. In upholding equity and justice, countries must discard extreme materialism and overemphasis on competition, and ensure that all countries have equal rights and opportunities for development. Mutually beneficial cooperation means that countries should reject the maximization of self-interest, address the legitimate concerns of other countries while pursuing their own interests, and promote common development of all countries alongside their own development. The foundations for building a new type of international relations lie in broader and deeper global partnerships based on equality, openness, and cooperation. China adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in pursuing friendship and cooperation with other countries. It works to reinforce coordination and positive interaction with other major countries in order to build major-country relations featuring peaceful coexistence, overall stability, and balanced development. Acting on the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness, and the policy of forging friendships and partnerships with its neighbors, China strives to increase friendly ties, mutual trust, and converging interests with its neighboring countries. Guided by the principles of sincerity, real results, amity, and good faith and with a commitment to the right approach to friendship and interests, China endeavors to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries and safeguard the common interests of the developing world. Major countries are key actors in building a new type of international relations. The international status of a country is measured by its openness of mind, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility rather than its size, strength or power. Major countries should direct their primary efforts to the future of humanity and assume greater responsibility for world peace and development, rather than wielding their power to seek monopoly over international and regional affairs. Major countries should strengthen coordination and cooperation, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, consider the perspectives of other parties and value mutual understanding, and treat smaller countries as equals. By building a global community of shared future, emerging countries and established powers can avoid falling into the Thucydides trap, find the right way to get along in mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and build common ground and achieve common development for different civilizations and countries with different social systems. 4. Practicing true multilateralism Building a global community of shared future requires practicing true multilateralism. Building cliques in the name of multilateralism is no more than bloc politics. Seeking supremacy in the name of multilateralism is still unilateral thinking. ""Selective multilateralism"" is practicing double standard. The world should be fair and free from domineering practices. China opposes all forms of unilateralism and the formation of camps and exclusive cliques targeting specific countries, and opposes actions that undermine the international order, create a new Cold War or stoke ideological confrontation in the name of the so-called rules-based order. China firmly upholds the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, as well as the authority and status of the United Nations. The various confrontations and injustices in today's world do not arise because the purposes and principles of the UN Charter are outdated, but rather because these purposes and principles are not effectively followed. China maintains that for the world, there is only one system, which is the international system with the United Nations at its core, that there is only one order, which is the international order based on international law, and that there is only one set of rules, which is the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. China actively participates in and leads the reform of the global governance system. It follows the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, that is, global affairs must be discussed by all, governance systems built by all, and benefits of governance shared by all, so that every country is a participant, contributor, and beneficiary of world peace and development. 5. Promoting the common values of humanity China advocates peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, the common values of humanity. With an open mind, China understands that different civilizations have different understandings of the nature of these values, and respects the efforts of people in different countries to explore their own development paths. It goes beyond the narrow historical limitations of the so-called universal values, and promotes the common values of humanity embedded in Chinese civilization. These are the values embodied in pursuing a global community of shared future. Peace and development are a common cause. A tree of peace cannot grow on barren land, nor can it bear the fruits of development amidst the flames of war. The fundamental solution to various global challenges lies in seeking peace and achieving development. Equity and justice are common ideals. No country should act as it pleases, or ride roughshod over others. Democracy and freedom are the common goals of humanity. There is no single model of democracy that is universally applicable, far less a superior one. Democracy is not Coca-Cola, tasting the same across the world as the syrup is produced in one single country. Democracy is not an ornament, but a solution to real problems. Attempts to monopolize the ""patent"" of democracy, arbitrarily define the ""standards"" of democracy, and fabricate a false narrative of ""democracy versus authoritarianism"" to provoke confrontation between political systems and ideologies are practices of fake democracy. Promoting the common values of humanity is not about canonizing the values of any particular country, but about seeking common ground while reserving differences, harmony without uniformity, and fully respecting the diversity of civilizations and the right of all countries to independently choose their social systems and development paths. The more advanced human society becomes, the more important it is to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations. All countries should treat each other with respect and as equals, discard arrogance and prejudice, deepen understanding of the differences between its own civilization and others, and promote dialogue and harmonious coexistence between different civilizations. Every country should value its own civilization, appreciate others, and facilitate their common progress. We should keep our own civilizations dynamic and create conditions for other civilizations to flourish. Together we can make the garden of world civilizations colorful and vibrant. All countries should be open and inclusive, promote mutual learning, strive to remove all barriers to cultural exchanges, and seek nourishment from other civilizations to promote the common development of all civilizations. All countries should progress with the times, explore new ground in development, take in the best of the present age, and sustain the development of civilizations through innovation. V. China's Action and Contribution A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. 1. Promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a vivid example of building a global community of shared future, and a global public good and cooperation platform provided by China to the world. Since introducing the BRI ten years ago, based on extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits, China has pursued open, green, clean, and high-standard cooperation to promote sustainable development and improve people\'s lives, and advanced high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. It has laid the groundwork and set up the frameworks of BRI cooperation, delivering tangible results and achieving sustainable progress. Together, participants in the initiative have jointly advanced ""hard connectivity"", ""soft connectivity"" and ""people-to-people connectivity"", setting up an important platform that has enabled wide participation, built international consensus and pooled the strengths of all parties. Panel 1 The Greek Port of Piraeus Getting a New Life Located strategically at the ""Southern Gate"" of Europe, Piraeus, the largest port in Greece, has played an important role since its opening in around 400 BC. More than a decade ago, the port was in crisis, suffering huge losses. In 2010, China COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited officially became involved in the operation of the port, injecting new vitality to it. The annual handling capacity of the port has now reached 7.2 million TEUs, and its global ranking has jumped from No. 93 in 2010 to No. 33 in 2022. It has created more than 3,000 direct jobs and more than 10,000 indirect jobs locally, resulting in direct social contributions of more than 1.4 billion euros to the area. Panel 2 Chinese Juncao Is Our ""Grass of Happiness"" Juncao technology, which uses grass instead of wood to cultivate edible fungi, has solved a significant challenge  that the production of edible fungi had to rely on felling trees. Over the past 20 years, China has held 270 international training sessions on Juncao technology that trained over 10,000 people from 106 countries. It has set up demonstration centers or bases in 16 countries, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs. In Fiji, Juncao technology is seen as a new hope of agriculture for island states; in Lesotho, farmers call Juncao ""the grass of prosperity"" because it makes quick returns; in Rwanda, more than 3,800 poor households have seen their annual incomes double or quadruple after they began Juncao production. Policy connectivity continues to deepen. By July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. China has successfully hosted the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in 2017 and the second in 2019, and will host the third this year, maximizing synergy for advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Infrastructure connectivity continues to strengthen. A general connectivity framework consisting of six corridors, six routes, and multiple countries and ports is in place. The overall layout of land, sea, air and cyberspace connectivity continues to improve, centered on economic corridors such as the New Eurasian Land Bridge, supported by routes like the China-Europe Railway Express and the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor and the information expressway, and underpinned by major railways, ports, and pipelines. Trade connectivity continues to increase. According to Belt and Road Economics, a report released by the World Bank, the BRI, when fully implemented, will increase intra-BRI trade by 4.1 percent. By 2030, the BRI will generate US$1.6 trillion in annual global revenues. Financial connectivity continues to expand. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund have been set up, providing financing support for hundreds of projects. People-to-people connectivity continues to strengthen. Roads, bridges and development belts that lead to a happier and better life are constantly emerging in participating countries, and solid progress is being achieved in Juncao, wells, hybrid rice and other small projects that work faster in improving people's lives, giving local people of BRI countries a stronger sense of gain and fulfillment. The BRI originated in China, but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, since its launch ten years ago, has lent strong impetus to the economic and social development of Pakistan. The China-Laos Railway has realized the long-cherished wish of the Lao people to convert Laos from a landlocked country to a land-linked hub. The Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway has become the first railway in Southeast Asia to reach a speed of 350 kilometers an hour. The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway has added more than two percentage points to local economic growth. Malawi\'s 600 wells built with Chinese assistance have become ""wells of happiness"" serving 150,000 local people. The China-Europe Railway Express serves as a ""steel camel fleet"" between China and Europe. Luban workshops help young people in Tajikistan and other countries acquire vocational skills. Cooperation in the fields of health, green development, digital economy, and innovation is thriving. Panel 3 China-Laos Railway and Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway The China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 km of roads and canals for villages along the railway, bringing many visible and tangible benefits to local people. As of January 31, 2023, the China-Laos Railway had run 20,000 passenger train journeys and handled 10.3 million passenger trips. The Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway, with a maximum designed speed of 350 kilometers per hour, is the first high-speed rail service in Southeast Asia. Now that the railway is in service, the commute time from Jakarta to Bandung has been reduced from more than three hours to just 40 minutes. The BRI is an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances. It is an open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party. Rather than forming exclusionary cliques or a ""China club"", it aims to help China and the rest of the world to seize opportunities and pursue common development. Rather than a private route for any one party, it is a broad path that can be joined by all interested countries to work together for shared benefits. The international community speaks highly of the BRI, praising it not simply as some random road or economic belt, but as an initiative to achieve common progress for humanity, an initiative that has opened up new paths for the common development of all countries. The BRI has facilitated the modernization drive of developing countries, leading the world into a new era of transcontinental cooperation. Panel 4 900 Days of Hard Work Leading to a 900-Second Miracle The Qamchiq Tunnel on the Angren-Pap Railway line is the first ever railway tunnel built in Uzbekistan, and one of the most important cooperation projects between China and Uzbekistan under the BRI framework. Construction started on September 5, 2013, and was completed on February 25, 2016. Chinese builders spent 900 days creating the miracle of a train passing through the mountains in only 900 seconds. The locals were astonished: ""In the global bidding for the project, the European and American companies offered a construction period of five years. But the Chinese company did it in 900 days. How did you make it?"" 2. Implementing the three global initiatives It is widely recognized that peace and stability, material sufficiency, and cultural-ethical enrichment represent the basic goals of human society. Development serves as the material foundation for security and civilization, security acts as the fundamental prerequisite for development and civilization, and civilization provides the cultural-ethical support for development and security. The Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative proposed by China guide the advance of human society across these three dimensions. Resonating and complementing each other, they have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity.  Through the Global Development Initiative, China has issued a resounding call for commitment to development and reinvigorated cooperation, and made its contribution to resolving challenges to development and advancing global development. The fundamental aim of the initiative is to accelerate the implementation of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its core requirement is a people-centered approach, its foremost philosophy is united, equal, balanced, and inclusive global development partnerships, and its pivotal measure entails results-oriented actions to bolster stronger, greener, and healthier global development and jointly build a global community of development. China has hosted the High-level Dialogue on Global Development and presented 32 major measures to implement the initiative, such as creating the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund totaling US$4 billion, launching the China-FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund (Phase III), and strengthening support for the China-UN Peace and Development Fund. Over the past two years, the international community has extensively responded to the initiative and jointly tackled prominent issues including food security, poverty reduction, and energy security as the implementation mechanism steadily improves and practical cooperation delivers progress. The Global Development Promotion Center is running smoothly, and the library of the Global Development Initiative projects is expanding, with over 200 projects achieving good results. At the same time, China has issued the Global Development Report, and established the Global Knowledge Network for Development, contributing Chinese wisdom to the resolution of developmental challenges. Currently, more than 100 countries and international organizations have expressed support for the Global Development Initiative, with over 70 countries participating in the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative established at the UN. China is committed to propelling global development through its own development. It has thoroughly applied the new development philosophy, with a focus on promoting high-quality development to foster a new development paradigm. Modernization of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people will create a market rivaling the aggregated size of all developed countries. This will open up more opportunities for all countries and stakeholders to partake in China's huge market. China has also pioneered major expos and fairs, exemplified by the China International Import Expo, China International Fair for Trade in Services, China Import and Export Fair, and China International Consumer Goods Expo. It has encouraged all countries and stakeholders to share the opportunities presented by China's institutional opening up and steadily expanded institutional opening up with regard to rules, regulations, management, and standards. It has enforced the Foreign Investment Law and its supporting rules and regulations, implemented the new catalogue for encouraging foreign investment, continued to remove items from the negative list of market access for foreign investment, advanced high-quality development of pilot free trade zones, and accelerated the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port. China is committed to win-win cooperation and common development. As the largest developing country in the world and a member of the Global South, China has made every effort to aid other developing countries and help recipient countries expand their capacity for development. China is actively engaged in international exchanges and cooperation. It has cooperated with almost 20 international organizations, including the UN World Food Programme, the UN Development Programme, the UN Children\'s Fund, the UN Refugee Agency, the World Health Organization, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and executed over 130 projects in nearly 60 countries including Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. ""Small but beautiful"", these projects span fields such as poverty reduction, food security, Covid-19 response, and climate change, and have benefited more than 30 million individuals. China worked actively for the adoption of and has comprehensively acted on the Debt Service Suspension Initiative of the Group of Twenty (G20), contributing more than any other G20 member to its implementation. China has signed agreements or reached understandings on the suspension of debt repayments with 19 African countries, helping Africa alleviate debt pressure. China is committed to building an open world economy. It has become the main trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, and signed 21 free trade agreements with 28 countries and regions. It has worked for high-quality implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, actively worked to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, and expanded its globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas. It has also promoted the internationalization of the Renminbi, and reinforced financial standards and its level of internationalization, thereby converging its interests closer with other countries.  Through the Global Security Initiative, China seeks to work with the international community in upholding the spirit of the UN Charter, and calls for adapting to the profound changes in the international landscape through solidarity, addressing traditional and non-traditional security risks and challenges with a win-win mindset, and creating a new path to security that features dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance, and win-win results over zero-sum game. Panel 5 Six Proposals of the Global Development Initiative  Staying committed to development as its first priority. Putting development front and center in the global macro policy framework, boosting policy coordination among major economies, ensuring policy continuity, consistency, and sustainability, fostering global development partnerships featuring greater equality and balance, coordinating multilateral development cooperation to generate synergy, and accelerating the implementation of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;  Staying committed to a people-centered approach. Ensuring and improving people's wellbeing and protecting and promoting human rights through development, ensuring that development is for the people and by the people and that its fruits are shared by the people, ensuring a stronger sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security for the people, and pursuing the people's well-rounded development;  Staying committed to inclusiveness and benefits for all. Addressing the special needs of developing countries, supporting developing countries-especially vulnerable countries facing exceptional difficulties  by means such as debt suspension and development aid, and addressing imbalanced and inadequate development among and within countries;  Staying committed to innovation-driven development. Seizing the historic opportunities created by the latest round of revolution in science and technology and industrial transformation, speeding up efforts to harness scientific and technological achievements to boost productivity, creating an open, fair, equitable, and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological advances, unleashing new impetus for post-pandemic economic growth, and joining hands to achieve leapfrog development;  Staying committed to harmony between humanity and nature. Improving global environmental governance, actively responding to climate change, building a community of life for humanity and nature, accelerating the transition to green and low-carbon development, and achieving green recovery and development;  Staying committed to results-oriented actions. Increasing the input of development resources, prioritizing cooperation in areas such as poverty reduction, food security, pandemic response and vaccines, financing for development, climate change and green development, industrialization, the digital economy, and connectivity, and building a global community of development. In February 2023, China officially released The Global Security Initiative Concept Paper. The document further elaborates the core concepts and principles of the initiative, elucidates its key avenues for cooperation, and presents recommendations and ideas concerning its cooperation platforms and mechanisms. This has demonstrated China's awareness of its duty to maintain world peace and its firm determination to safeguard global security. As an international public good, the Global Security Initiative serves the interests of and maintains peace for people throughout the world. Panel 6 Six Proposals of the Global Security Initiative  Staying committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security, and working together to maintain world peace and security;  Staying committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, upholding non-interference in others' internal affairs, and respecting the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries;  Staying committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, rejecting the Cold War mentality, opposing unilateralism, and saying no to bloc politics and camp-based confrontation;  Staying committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, upholding the principle of indivisible security, building a balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture, and opposing the pursuit of one's own security to the detriment of others' security;  Staying committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation, supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, rejecting double standards, and opposing the arbitrary use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction;  Staying committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and working together to address regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity, and biosecurity. China is a pillar in maintaining world peace. It is committed to handling disputes with relevant countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests through negotiation and consultation. It has settled land boundary issues peacefully with 12 of its 14 neighbors along its land borders through negotiation and consultation, and delimited the maritime boundary in the Beibu Bay with Vietnam. China has faithfully fulfilled its responsibilities and missions as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is the second largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping assessment, and the largest contributor of peacekeeping troops among the permanent members of the Security Council. Over the past three decades and more, having sent more than 50,000 personnel to UN peacekeeping operations in over 20 countries and regions, China has become a key force in UN peacekeeping. China has dispatched more than 100 naval vessels in 45 taskforces to the Gulf of Aden and waters off the coast of Somalia to provide escort for over 7,000 Chinese and foreign ships. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria, and Afghanistan. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four key principles, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis. China has dispatched the Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran have achieved historic reconciliation, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has actively cooperated with other parties in non-traditional security domains such as anti-terrorism, biosecurity, and food security. It has proposed the International Cooperation Initiative on Global Food Security within the framework of the G20, and pushed for the adoption of the Strategy on Food Security Cooperation of the BRICS Countries. It has also officially launched the China-Pacific Island Countries Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Cooperation Center, representing yet another robust action to help developing countries tackle non-traditional security challenges within the context of the Global Security Initiative. Panel 7 China's Major Propositions on Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis Four key principles:  The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be upheld;  The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed;  The legitimate security concerns of all parties should be taken seriously;  All efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis should be supported. Four things that the international community should do together:  The international community should jointly support all efforts to peacefully settle the Ukraine crisis, call on the parties concerned to stay rational, exercise restraint, and conduct direct engagement as quickly as possible, and create conditions for the resumption of negotiations;  The international community should jointly oppose the threat or use of nuclear weapons and advocate that nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought, to avoid a nuclear crisis on the Eurasian continent;  The international community should jointly work to keep global industrial and supply chains stable and prevent disruptions to international cooperation in energy, food, and finance that could undermine the global economic recovery, especially the economic and financial stability of developing countries;  The international community should jointly provide winter relief to civilians in conflict zones, and improve humanitarian conditions, with a view to preventing a humanitarian crisis on a larger scale. Three observations:  Conflicts and wars produce no winner;  There is no simple solution to a complex issue;  Confrontation between major countries must be avoided.  Through the Global Civilization Initiative, China calls for jointly advocating respect for the diversity of civilizations, jointly advocating the common values of humanity, jointly advocating the importance of continuity and evolution of civilizations, and jointly advocating closer international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. The Global Civilization Initiative makes a sincere call for the world to enhance inter-civilization exchanges and dialogue, and promote human progress with inclusiveness and mutual learning, inspiring the building of a global community of shared future. China has hosted gatherings including the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-level Meeting, the CPC and World Political Parties Summit, and the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations. It has engaged in extensive bilateral and multilateral activities for political party exchanges and cooperation, and promoted diverse forms of civil diplomacy, city diplomacy, and public diplomacy. China has continued to deepen cooperation with the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the UN World Tourism Organization. It now has 43 items inscribed on the intangible cultural heritage lists of UNESCO. China has celebrated over 30 large-scale cultural and tourist ""years"" (festivals), such as the China-Italy Year of Culture and Tourism, the China-Greece Year of Culture and Tourism, and the China-Spain Year of Culture and Tourism. It has promoted the steady development of 16 multilateral exchanges and cooperation mechanisms, such as the meeting of BRICS ministers of culture, as well as 25 bilateral cooperation mechanisms. It regularly hosts cultural activities at home, such as the Arabic Arts Festival and the Meet in Beijing International Arts Festival, and has held ""Happy Spring Festival"" celebrations outside China for more than 20 years in a row. It hosted approximately 2,000 events across over 130 countries in 2017, and has organized activities around the world under such brands as ""Tea for Harmony"" Yaji Cultural Salon. It has advanced cultural and tourism exchanges under the Belt and Road Initiative, carried out the Cultural Silk Road program, and established the Silk Road international theater, museum, art festival, library, and art museum alliances. It has also established approximately 3,000 pairs of sister cities or provinces with various countries, and launched the ""Nihao! China ""inbound tourism promotion program. Panel 8 Four Proposals of the Global Civilization Initiative  Jointly advocating respect for the diversity of civilizations. Countries should uphold equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness among civilizations, and let cultural exchanges transcend estrangement, mutual learning transcend conflict, and inclusiveness transcend supremacy.  Jointly advocating the common values of humanity. Peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom are shared aspirations of people across the world. Countries should be open to appreciating different perceptions of values by different civilizations, and refrain from imposing their own values or models on others and from stoking ideological confrontation.  Jointly advocating the importance of continuity and evolution of civilizations. Countries should fully harness the relevance of their histories and cultures to the present times, and push for creative transformation and innovative development of their fine traditional cultures in the course of modernization.  Jointly advocating closer international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. Countries should explore the building of a global network for inter-civilization dialogue and cooperation, enrich the contents of exchanges and expand avenues of cooperation to promote mutual understanding and friendship among people of all countries, and jointly advance the progress of human civilization. The international community has spoken highly of these three global initiatives, acknowledging that they reflect China's global vision and growing international influence and provide comprehensive solutions to the challenges confronting humanity. The Global Development Initiative is highly compatible with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and resonates, in particular, with the aspirations of developing countries for greater development. The Global Security Initiative upholds the principle of common security, emphasizes comprehensive approaches, pursues sustainable security through cooperative efforts, and makes a valuable contribution to addressing international security challenges. The Global Civilization Initiative calls on all countries to respect the diversity of civilizations in the world, which is conducive to facilitating exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations. 3. Working with more countries and regions China has proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future, and is working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, thereby playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. The China-Africa community of shared future was the first regional proposal. It values sincerity and equality, pursues both friendship and interests and puts friendship first, takes a people-oriented approach in pursuing practical and efficient cooperation, and follows an open and inclusive approach to cooperation. It has set a good example of China and African countries building a community of shared future. The China-Arab community of shared future, China-Latin America and the Caribbean community of shared future, and China-Pacific Island Countries community of shared future have all made swift and steady progress. They are vivid illustrations of solidarity, cooperation, and common progress among developing countries. The community of shared future among neighboring countries has taken firm root. As the China-ASEAN community of shared future continues to make advances, China-ASEAN cooperation has evolved into the most fruitful, dynamic, and substantive cooperation in East Asia. The two sides have seen a steady increase in mutual trust, engaged in frequent high-level exchanges, and established dialogue and cooperation mechanisms in nearly 50 domains and institutions. The community of shared future of Lancang-Mekong countries continues to make progress. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization community of shared future has yielded substantial outcomes. The building of the China-Central Asia community of shared future has made solid steps forward. The first China-Central Asia Summit was a success and a meeting mechanism at the heads-of-state level between China and Central Asian countries has been established. These efforts have contributed to enduring peace and shared prosperity in the region and the wider world. At the bilateral level, China is building communities of shared future with an increasing number of partners in different forms. China and countries including Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Pakistan, Mongolia, Cuba and South Africa have published action plans, released joint statements, or reached important agreements on building bilateral communities of shared future. China has also implemented the vision of building a global community of shared future on a bilateral level with all the five Central Asian countries. As this vision gains greater traction among the people, substantial outcomes have been delivered, significantly boosting local development and improving people's lives. The global community of shared future is a dynamic, open, and inclusive system. However different countries may be in geographical location, history, culture, social system, size of economy, and development stage, alignment with the core idea of a global community of shared future enables them to seek common ground while shelving differences, achieve harmony in diversity, reinforce cooperation, and pursue win-win outcomes. China will work with more and more regions and countries to build a global community of shared future and contribute to the development of all countries and the progress of human civilization. 4. Boosting international cooperation in all areas The vision of a global community of shared future addresses the deficits in peace, development, security, and governance facing the world today. As China's unique contribution to solving global problems, it also offers solutions which have been translated into concrete actions in areas such as health, climate change, and cybersecurity. Confronted by the rampant Covid-19 pandemic, China proposed to build a community of health for all. It has stood in the frontline of international anti-pandemic cooperation, carrying out global emergency humanitarian relief and providing assistance and support to more than 150 countries and international organizations. China has advocated that vaccines must first and foremost be a global public good, and was among the first countries to make a commitment to supply Covid-19 vaccines as a global public good, to support waiving intellectual property rights on the vaccines, and to start joint production with other developing countries. It has also played a pioneering role in the equitable distribution of vaccines, contributing China's strength to the global health cause through firm commitment and practical actions. To address disorder in cyberspace governance, China has proposed the concept of a community of shared future in cyberspace. It actively participates in UN cybersecurity processes and supports the UN in playing a core role in global cyberspace governance. China has hosted the World Internet Conference and established the World Internet Conference Organization as a platform for global internet sharing and governance. To advance the development of a set of rules for global digital governance, it has launched the Global Data Security Initiative, and released the China-LAS Cooperation Initiative on Data Security together with the League of Arab States and the Data Security Cooperation Initiative of China +Central Asia together with the five Central Asian countries. To ensure that rights and responsibilities are shared among all countries, it promotes the improvement of governance rules in the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, and other new frontiers. Efforts are made to ensure that in formulating new rules for governance in new frontiers, the interests and expectations of emerging market countries and developing countries are fully reflected. Concerning the fundamental issues in global nuclear security governance, China proposes to build a community of shared future on nuclear security. It firmly safeguards the international nuclear nonproliferation regime, promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and upholds a rational, coordinated and balanced approach to nuclear security. In response to the increasing risk of nuclear conflict, China has pushed for the conclusion of a joint statement among the leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states, reaffirming that ""a nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought"".China actively advocates the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and it is the only nuclear country that has publicly committed to no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-weapon-free zones. Faced with increasingly complex maritime issues, China has proposed to form a maritime community of shared future and has always been committed to peaceful resolution of territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests disputes through dialogue and consultation. China has signed and fully and effectively implemented the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea with ASEAN countries, and continues to advance consultations on the code of conduct in the South China Sea. China has proposed to jointly build a partnership on blue economy and strengthen maritime connectivity. It adheres to the path of pursuing joint development while setting aside disputes, and actively explores joint resource development with maritime neighbors at sea. Faced with the severe and growing global climate challenge, China has proposed important concepts such as building a community of life for humanity and nature and a community of all life on Earth. China actively promotes economic development and transformation, and undertakes to strive to achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. It has introduced a ""1+N"" policy system for carbon peaking and neutrality. China has built the world\'s largest clean power generation network, contributed 25 percent of the world\'s newly added green area since 2000, and enabled an annual economic growth rate of over 6 percent with an average annual energy consumption growth rate of 3 percent. It has the largest installed capacity of hydropower, wind power, and solar power in the world. It actively participates in global environmental governance, advocates the comprehensive and effective implementation by the international community of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and adheres to the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"". China tries its best to help developing countries improve their ability to address climate change, and vigorously supports their green and low-carbon energy development. It has inked 46 South-South cooperation documents with 39 developing countries to address climate change, and trained approximately 2,300 officials and technical personnel in the field of climate change for more than 120 developing countries. Holding the presidency of the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15), China made every effort to ensure the success of the meeting, taking the lead in funding the establishment of the Kunming Biodiversity Fund and contributing to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Panel 9 The Northern Trek of Wandering Elephants In March 2020, a group of wild Asian elephants from the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve in Yunnan Province traveled north, passing through multiple places in the province. After traveling for about a year and a half, they safely returned home under the care and meticulous protection of the local government and people. The collective migration of Asian elephants made regular headlines in China, and attracted the attention of netizens around the world, sparking lively domestic and international discussions on building a home on Earth featuring harmony between man and nature. Whether dealing with the current crises or creating a better future together, all countries need to unite and cooperate. Faced with profound changes unseen in a century, China has proposed the building of a global community of shared future, calls on all countries to uphold the concept of a shared future, fully communicate and consult with each other, share governance responsibilities, and form broad consensus and take concerted actions to address global issues, so as to inject confidence and momentum into humanity's drive towards a bright future. Conclusion All good principles should adapt to changing times in order to remain relevant. A broad consensus of solidarity and cooperation has developed in the international community behind the proposal and the implementation of the concept of a global community of shared future to address the challenges facing humanity. Looking to the future, it is bound to shine as a pioneering thought with the power of truth that transcends time and space, opening up a beautiful prospect of common development, long-term stability, and sustained prosperity for human society. The future of humanity is bright, but it will not come without effort. Building a global community of shared future is both a salutary vision and a historical process that calls for generations of hard work. To realize this goal, confidence and determination are of foremost importance. The trend of our times for peace, development and win-win cooperation cannot be halted. Building a global community of shared future is the way forward for all the world's peoples. However, it is not a goal to be accomplished overnight, and there will be no plain sailing. We need to make unremitting efforts and forge ahead with perseverance. We should never give up on our dreams because of harsh realities; we should never stop pursuing our ideals because they seem out of reach. To realize this goal, a broad mind and a global vision are central as we live in great times. In the face of common challenges, no person or country can remain isolated. The only response is to work together in harmony and unity. Only by strengthening coordination and cooperation, and ensuring that the interests of the people of every country will be kept in line with those of all others, can all countries move forward towards a global community of shared future. To realize this goal, a sense of responsibility and a will to act hold the key. The key to success is simple and boils down to action. Building a global community of shared future depends on the joint actions of all countries. All countries should take a sense of responsibility that treats the task as a bound duty, and take concrete actions instead of being bystanders. We should strengthen dialogue, build consensus, promote peace and development, improve governance, and carry out global actions, global responses, and global cooperation. Our journey ahead will be a lengthy and arduous one. But as long as we press ahead with perseverance, there will be much to expect. Successes and setbacks await us, but hopes abound. When all countries unite in pursuing the cause of common good, plan together, and act together day by day towards the right direction of building a global community of shared future, we can build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity, and jointly create a better future for all of humanity.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202309/27/65137a58a310d2dc6d2896e8.png'],"['The Africa CDC headquarters building in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Jan 11, 2023.

6,A Journey through Yantai: Unraveling the secrets of China's wine city,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\201908\02\WS5d43daaca310cf3e35563916_2.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201908/02/WS5d43daaca310cf3e35563916.html,"Over the next two days, we, along with an eclectic group of foreigners hailing from such diverse countries as Ethiopia, Pakistan, the UK, Italy, Georgia, Peru, and the US, toured the citys many wine-related sites. We visited the Heishangmei Raspberry Wine Chateau, where we partook in evening revelries that included eating, singing, dancing, and plenty of wine drinking. We visited the Changyu Wine Culture Museum, where we learned about the history of Chinas wine industry and found ourselves face to face with giant, 100-plus-year-old oak barrels capable of producing 20,000 bottles of wine. Arguably the most memorable place we visited on our once-in-a-lifetime tour of Yantai was the Chateau Changyu-Castel, where Changyus wine-making magic really happens. This unforgettable locale consists of 135 hectares of stunning vineyards, with a charming European-style castle situated amid the seemingly endless greenery. However, no less impressive was Changyus nearby wine production center, a remarkably massive structure cleverly designed to look like a bunch of enormous barrels of wine. But luckily, we didnt find ourselves drowning in a sea of wine upon entering them. Rather, we were treated to a fascinating tour of the facilities and bared witness to all the advanced technology required to produce wine on the scale that Changyu does. So ultimately, was the trip worth it? You betcha. After all, who could pass up the opportunity to visit such a remarkable seaside city like Yantai and try out some of the best wine in all of China? If youre ever in the area, or youd love some nice wine, or if you simply feel like exploring a beautiful city, give Yantai a try. I doubt you will regret it.

The culture of any country represents its national psychology and identity. People's values and opinions are transmitted to state leaders through the media and other information channels, influencing foreign policy decisions both directly and indirectly. My name is Haroon Ali Kabeer. I am from Pakistan. As a foreigner, I am impressed with Chinese culture, infrastructure and landscapes. I have been to many cities in China like the capital city of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi'an, Urumqi, Suzhou and everywhere in Shandong. As an academician, I understand the importance of proper research and documentation of sources. In this article, I will share my personal experience of living and working in China as an international student and foreign teacher, which has changed my life. I aim to provide an enlightening and insightful account of my life in this culturally rich and diverse country. China is a country filled with vibrant culture, rich history and breathtaking landscapes. The country's rich culture, with its unique and advanced educational system, has made it a popular destination for international students all around the world. In 2016, I came to China to pursue my studies and I must say it was the best decision I have made in my life. Another reason for choosing China was the iron-clad relationship between Pakistan and China. I knew the Chinese are friendly with foreigners, especially with Pakistanis.

The city was bustling with people, the air smelled of street food, and the LED lights on buildings were telling me that I was in another world. On the second day I arrived in Jinan at Shandong University where I did my IMBA. My first few months were a bit challenging because of the language barrier, but thanks to the friendly and helpful locals, I was able to navigate my way around quickly. One of the things I noticed was how Chinese people value education. They take their studies seriously, and schools have a meaningful curriculum. From primary schools to universities, education is highly regarded, and that is evident in the quality of the education system. The education system in China has been modeled to ensure that students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in life. As I settled down, I realized that by learning Chinese I should also explore the cultural heritage of China. As the country has a fascinating history, there are historical sites to visit everywhere you go. From the Forbidden City in Beijing and the Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an to Mount Tai in Tai'an, as well as Baotu Spring, Daming Lake and Mount Qianfo in Jinan, China has a myriad of popular tourist destinations with cultural and historical significance. After completing my IMBA, I landed a job as a teacher at the Shandong Institute of Commerce and Technology (SICT). It was my best decision in China so far to come to SICT. School leaders, colleagues and all the management staff are supporting. The overall experience has been fulfilling and exciting. Working in China has allowed me to experience the culture more in-depth, and I have had the chance to teach international business courses to young learners, which has been rewarding. Recently, I participated in a speech contest with the theme of ""The Yellow River in My Eyes"" and I won third prize. I also got an opportunity to learn the history of the Yellow River and explored the Yellow River estuary in Dongying. In conclusion, China has become my second home. Living and working in China has been a truly unique and remarkable experience. China has changed my life completely. I have learned so much about China's rich culture and history, met inspiring people and gained a broader understanding of the world. I hope that my experiences will inspire others to explore the rich culture and history that China has to offer.","['http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202305/11/645c4cc6a310b60580ccb6fb.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202305/11/645c4cc6a310b60580ccb6fd.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202305/11/645c4cc6a310b60580ccb6ff.jpeg']","['Haroon Ali Kabeer.

10,America's Coercive Diplomacy and Its Harm,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202305\19\WS6466b512a310b6054fad3d2a.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202305/19/WS6466b512a310b6054fad3d2a.html,"Introduction The United States is used to accusing other countries of using great power status, coercive policies and economic coercion to coerce other countries to obey and engage in coercive diplomacy, but in fact, the United States is the instigator of coercive diplomacy. The invention rights, patent rights and intellectual property rights of coercive diplomacy all belong to the United States. For a long time, the United States will do everything possible to coerce other countries, and the United States has a very disgraceful ""dark history"" in coercive diplomacy. Today, coercive diplomacy is a standard instrument in the US foreign policy toolbox, and containment and suppression in political, economic, military, cultural and other fields have been used to conduct coercive diplomacy around the world for pure US self-interest. Countries around the world have suffered, with developing countries bearing the brunt of it, and even US\' allies and partners have not been spared. Based on abundant facts and data, this report aims to expose the evil deeds of US coercive diplomacy in the world and make the international community better understand the hegemonic and bullying nature of US diplomacy, and the serious damages caused by US actions to the development of all countries, regional stability and world peace. I. The United States' coercive diplomacy has a notorious record In 1971, Alexander George, a professor at Stanford University, first put forward the concept of ""coercive diplomacy,"" which was used to summarize the policies of the United States on Laos, Cuba and Vietnam. In his view, coercive diplomacy concerns the use of threat or limited force to coerce an adversary to stop or reverse its action. In the past half century, the US has never stopped engaging in coercive diplomacy in spite of great changes in the international structure. From economic sanctions to technical blockade, and from political isolation to threat of force, the US has demonstrated what coercive diplomacy is to the world with its own actions. The developing countries are the ""worst-hit areas"" of America\'s coercive diplomacy. In 1962, the United States imposed an economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba which continues to this day. The US-Cuba diplomatic relations were restored in 2015, but the US did not fully lift its blockade against Cuba. In 2017, the Trump administration tightened sanctions on Cuba again. In 2021, the Biden administration twice extended the ""Trading with the Enemy Act,"" which has served as the legal basis for the blockade and embargo against Cuba. The 61-year-old embargo has brought enormous economic losses and grave humanitarian disasters to Cuba. The US sanctions and blockade on Cuba cover almost everything from fuel, food and daily necessities to medicine, leaving the island facing a chronic and severe shortage of supplies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States also blocked Cuba\'s access to raw materials for vaccine production. The People\'s World, an American news website, pointed out in an article that the blockade imposed by the United States had prevented Cuba from obtaining materials for the manufacture of syringes in time. Since the United States has banned third countries from selling ventilators to Cuba, Cuba has not been able to purchase the ventilators needed to save critically ill COVID-19 patients, which has caused great harm to the Cuban people. Since 2006, the US has imposed sanctions on Venezuela, preventing Venezuela from entering the US financial system. During the Trump administration, the US expanded economic and financial sanctions against Venezuela, froze all assets of the Venezuelan government in the US, and imposed sanctions on its oil, banking, mining industries and more than 140 government personnel, which severely hit the Venezuelan economy. Venezuelan crude oil production fell from nearly 2.5 million barrels per day in 2016 to just 300,000 barrels per day in 2020.During the COVID-19 pandemic, US sanctions made it difficult for Venezuela to obtain materials to combat the pandemic and basic commodities such as food, drinking water and gasoline in a timely manner. According to the report released by the UN Special Rapporteur Du Han on the Negative Effects of Unilateral Enforcement Measures on Human Rights, the sanctions have left more than one-third of the population of Venezuela in a serious food crisis and a shortage of basic medical supplies and equipment; conditions of health care services have deteriorated and maternal, infant and seriously ill patients deaths have increased. In June 2020, the US Treasury Department announced the imposition of penalties on three Mexican entrepreneurs and eight Mexican companies, freezing their US assets, for allegedly helping Venezuela evade US sanctions, and prohibiting them from participating in any transaction involving US individuals and entities. Since 2006, successive US administrations have continuously strengthened sanctions on the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Since 1988, the United States has for many years included the DPRK in the list of ""state sponsors of terrorism."" In 2016, then president Barack Obama signed the ""North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act"" to supplement the sanctions already imposed by past administrations. In 2017, the US imposed further sanctions on the DPRK through the ""Countering America\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act"" and demanded that SWIFT cut off the DPRK banks from their global banking network. The US sanctions on the DPRK include restrictions on trade imports and exports, prohibition on the DPRK citizens from working overseas, freezing of assets in the US, and prohibition on economic ties with the DPRK. In November of the same year, three aircraft carriers of the US Navy, including USS Reagan, USS Roosevelt and USS Nimitz, appeared in the East China Sea at the same time and jointly held high-intensity military exercises with the South Korean Navy, which attracted great attention from the outside world. Twice kicking Iran out of the SWIFT system and disrupting the international financial order. The United States first imposed economic sanctions against Iran in 1979, when it froze $1.2 billion worth of Iranian assets abroad and eventually expanding to a full trade embargo. As the Iranian nuclear issue has evolved, the US has banned Iranian financial institutions from using the US clearing and payment system to settle transactions in US dollars, forcing Iran to decouple from the US dollar. In 2012, in order to contain Iran in an all-round way, the United States and the European Union removed Iran from the SWIFT system, making it impossible for Iran to conduct cross-border transactions with the US dollar, the euro and any international currency, and the value of Iran's currency depreciated by about 38% in a year. Iran's foreign trade fell into recession, with imports and exports falling sharply and crude oil exports cut by half. In 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and once again kicked Iran out of the SWIFT system. According to a study by a US think tank, Iran has lost half of its oil exports and 30% of its foreign trade income due to the sanctions. The US government has wantonly wielded the club of sanctions against Iran, which has sparked criticism from all quarters. In 2019, Jake Sullivan, who is now national security advisor to President Joe Biden, wrote an article criticizing the Trump administration's policy toward Iran, saying that it has nothing but coercion and no diplomacy. Sanctions imposed on Belarus. Since 2004, the United States has imposed 17 rounds of targeted sanctions on Belarus. Currently, 16 people, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, are under US sanctions ranging from travel bans to asset freezes. In addition, 10 Belarusian companies have been barred from the US market. Unilateral sanctions imposed on African countries such as Sudan. In 1993, the United States announced sanctions against Sudan. In 1997, the Clinton administration announced sweeping economic sanctions against Sudan. In 2017, the US still added Sudan to the list of ""state sponsors of terrorism,"" and various sanctions against Sudan continued to be implemented, including the prohibition on investments in, trade with, and loans to Sudan. Years of US sanctions have led to a severe humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with a large number of children across the country dying of malnutrition, according to a report released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan. In addition, the United States has imposed targeted sanctions against individuals and organizations in African countries such as Burundi, the Central African Republic, Somalia and Zimbabwe. All-round sanctions on Russia. In 2014, the US issued a ban on medium and long-term financing of Russia\'s defense, financial and energy sectors. In April 2018, the US again announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, freezing all their assets under US jurisdiction. In November 2021, the US announced further sanctions related to the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project. After the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US coerced many countries to issue the ""Joint Statement on Further Restrictive Economic Measures"" against Russia, banning the import of Russian crude oil, liquefied natural gas and coal, and restricting US investments in most Russian energy companies, while removing major Russian banks from SWIFT. To date, the United States and its allies have directly sanctioned more than 2,500 Russian companies, government officials and individuals. Violating the principle of fair trade and imposing tariffs on China. In July 2018, the US launched a trade war with China, announcing a 25% tariff on approximately $34 billion of goods imported from China; in August, an additional 25% tariff on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods was announced; and in September, the US announced yet again a 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese imports. In May 2019, it was announced that tariffs on the $200 billion of Chinese goods would be raised from 10% to 25%; in August, it was announced that additional tariffs on about $550 billion of Chinese goods exported to the US would be raised, escalating the China-US trade war. Tech blockade against China in the semiconductor sector. In August 2022, the ""CHIPS and Science Act"" was enacted. The law, which plans to provide up to $52.7 billion in government subsidies for the US semiconductor industry, requires semiconductor companies that receive federal financial aid not to make substantive expansion in countries such as China. The US government has joined Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taiwan to form the so-called ""Chip 4"" in an attempt to limit the development of China\'s semiconductor industry. Using state power to suppress China\'s high-tech enterprises. The previous administration of the United States launched the ""Clean Network"" program, which took national security and privacy of its citizens as an excuse, explicitly requiring the elimination of Chinese enterprises such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba in five aspects, namely, telecommunications networks, mobile application stores, mobile application programs, cloud services and undersea cables. The then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other US politicians lobbied and coerced other countries and regions to join the so-called ""Clean Network"" alliance. Senior US officials even intimidated countries such as Cyprus, demanding that they not cooperate with Chinese 5G suppliers, or the consequences would be serious. The US has put more than 1,000 Chinese companies, including ZTE, Huawei and DJI, on various sanctions lists, using national security as an excuse to clamp down on Chinese social media apps such as TikTok and WeChat. Under the guise of democracy and human rights, the US has hyped up questions concerning Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang. The ""TAIPEI Act,"" the ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,"" the ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"" and other bills related to China have been produced, and they are firmly linked to issues of trade and technological exchanges with China. It unjustifiably interferes in China\'s internal affairs and coerces Western countries into keeping with the US. US hyped up the so-called ""lab leak theory"" of the coronavirus and spared no efforts to smear and stigmatize China. In disregard of the ""Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019,"" the US used its intelligence services to issue the so-called assessment on COVID-19 origins. The US insists on politicizing and taking advantage of the issue of tracing the origin of the virus, casting a shadow over global cooperation to combat the pandemic. The US sanctioning Indian companies for engaging in oil trade with Iran for the first time. India's Economic Times, The Times of India and other media outlets reported that the US imposed sanctions on Mumbai-based petrochemical trading company Tibalaji Petrochem in October 2022, which marks the first time that US imposed sanctions on an Indian company for engaging in oil trade with Iran. In April 2023, the Indian Foreign Ministry announced that the governments of India and Malaysia had agreed to settle trade between the two countries in Indian rupees. Applying coercive diplomacy with allies with no mercy. In the 1980s, Japan\'s GDP was half that of the US. In order to eliminate Japan\'s economic threat, the United States forced Japan to sign the ""Plaza Accord"" in 1985, forcing the yen to appreciate, which led to the rapid expansion of Japan\'s domestic economic bubble, the collapse of the real estate bubble and the long-term stagnation of the Japanese economy. In 1986, in response to the rise of Japan\'s semiconductor industry, the US forced Japan to sign the ""US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement,"" initiated a ""Section 301 Investigation"" against Japan, and imposed trade sanctions on a variety of Japanese products such as semiconductors and computers, which undermined the competitiveness and potential of Japan\'s semiconductor industry, seeing its market share fall from 50% of the global market to about 10% in 2019. Dismembering Alstom by means of ""economic hostages."" In 2013, the US used the ""Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"" to arrest Frederic Pierucci, an Alstom executive, and coaxed him to enter into a plea agreement in order to obtain more evidence and information against Alstom. By 2014, to pressure Alstom, US authorities had arrested at least three more of Pierucci\'s former colleagues, using ""economic hostages"" as bargaining chips. Under lobbying and pressure, Alstom had to accept an acquisition bid from General Electric of the US in 2015. In its review, The Economist said the US Department of Justice investigation had distorted the process by which Alstom sold assets, creating an advantage for potential US buyers. Wielding the tariff club at Europe and interfering in market competition. In 2018, the US government used Section 232 of the ""Trade Expansion Act of 1962"" to impose tariffs of up to 25% and 10% on steel and aluminum products respectively in several countries and regions, including the EU, purportedly on the grounds of safeguarding national security. In January 2021, to improve Boeing\'s competitive advantage, the US Customs and Border Protection announced tariffs of up to 15% on imports from France and Germany, including aircraft parts, involving a total value of $7.5 billion. In recent years, the US has targeted its coercive measures on the semiconductor industry, ""extorting"" confidential data from many chip companies in the world and maintaining US dominance in the semiconductor industry. In September 2021, the US Department of Commerce issued a notice requiring companies in the semiconductor supply chain to provide relevant information ""voluntarily"" within 45 days, including 26 core items of data such as inventory, production capacity, supply cycle and customer information. In an interview with Reuters, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said that if the companies refused, instruments such as the ""Defense Production Act"" would be used to get them to provide the data. Data from US government website shows that under pressure from the US, as of November 2021, more than 70 companies, including TSMC, UMC, Samsung, SK hynix and Japan\'s Sony Semiconductor, have submitted information related to the semiconductor supply chain to the US Department of Commerce. In addition to the economic and financial sanctions, the US is also good at interfering, either directly or indirectly, in the internal affairs of other countries by supporting proxy wars, inciting civil wars, providing weapons and ammunition, and training anti-government forces, etc., to counter ""disobedient"" countries and regions. Since the 20th century, under the banner of ""democracy"" and ""freedom,"" the United States has promoted the ""Neo-Monroe Doctrine"" in Latin America, provoked ""color revolutions"" in Eurasia, and planned the ""Arab Spring"" in West Asia and North Africa, engaging in ""peaceful evolution"" in various parts of the world, wantonly engaging in hegemonic bullying and sending out a clear message that whoever follows it will survive and whoever defies it shall perish. Since 2003, the US has played a hand in the ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia, the ""Orange Revolution"" in Ukraine and the ""Tulip Revolution"" in Kyrgyzstan. The Financial Times reported that agencies such as the US National Endowment for Democracy and the US Agency for International Development have been instrumental in driving domestic protests in other countries. The main and immediate cause of the color revolution is to safeguard US interests such as strategic expansion and energy security, according to a British Open Democracy Network article. According to the American scholar Lindsey A. O\'Rourke\'s ""Covert Regime Change: America\'s Secret Cold War"", the United States carried out 64 covert regime change operations and six overt operations from 1947 to 1989. During the 1994 Haitian crisis, the US forced Haiti\'s military government to abandon power through a small-scale invasion. The administration at the time hailed the action as a model of coercive diplomacy. In 2003, the Bush administration listed 30.3 billion US dollars in additional military spending for coercive diplomacy. The US, despite being so angry about outside interference, is the expert in it, The Guardian said. II. The United States has many means of coercive diplomacy The hegemony of US dollar is an important foundation for US economic coercion. The ""petrodollar,"" the ""one-vote veto power"" of the United States in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the bilateral currency swap led by the Federal Reserve are all concrete manifestations of the hegemony of the US dollar. As an international settlement currency, the US dollar accounts for the majority of global trade and investment, enabling the US to pass domestic economic problems onto other countries through export inflation and trade deficits. The US controls the pricing power of major global commodities and resources and can influence the economies and finances of other countries by controlling the exchange rate and interest rate of the US dollar. As a currency of international sanctions, the US dollar occupies a central position in the global financial system, enabling the US to cut off other countries\' dollar supply and trading channels and impose pressure and sanction on other countries by restricting the channels of financing and transaction remittance. Freezing property, imposing huge fines and refusing financial services are all the usual tricks of the US to impose economic blockade and financial sanctions on other countries by taking advantage of the US dollar hegemony. Trade control is an important means of US economic coercion. The United States has various forms of trade control, including sanctions, restrictions on imports and exports, imposition of tariffs, elimination of subsidies and quotas, and has set up a variety of trade control lists to fit different purposes and targets, including lists of specially designated nationals, lists of entities, unverified lists, lists of military end users, and lists of industry sanctions. The US often wantonly imposes tariff in disregard of international law and international trade rules, forcing other countries to engage in unequal trade negotiations with it. In recent years, the US has frequently restricted investment in telecommunications, semiconductor, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies sectors on the grounds of ""endangering national security,"" and included foreign entities or individuals in the entity list of export control, restricting their purchase of US technologies. Through the signing of executive orders, the US puts mandatory stops on foreign enterprises\' operations in the US or prohibits US entities or individuals from trading with foreign enterprises, imposing technological sanctions on other countries, thus seriously undermining the international economic and trade order and the process of economic globalization. ""Long-arm jurisdiction"" is another commonly used means of US economic coercion. The US has enacted such domestic laws as the ""Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,"" the ""Trading with the Enemy Act,"" the ""Countering America\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,"" the ""International Emergency Economic Powers Act,"" and the ""Export Control Act,"" and cooked up a series of executive orders, directly imposing sanctions on specific countries, organizations or individuals. The US arbitrarily expands the jurisdiction of its domestic law, while applying ambiguous rules such as the ""minimum contact principle"" and the ""effectiveness principle,"" abusing domestic channels of judicial action to engage in ""long-arm jurisdiction"" with foreign entities and individuals. The promotion of the so-called democracy and human rights is a common trick of the US to carry out political coercion and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The United States has long promoted ""American values"" worldwide, played up ""democracy versus authoritarianism,"" wantonly interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, and attempted to shape other countries and world order with its own values and political system. They even interfere with and subvert the legitimate government of other countries in order to weaken rivals, pass on crisis, create chaos, and undermine stability. The targets of US political coercion are all-encompassing. Be it an adversary or an ally, a developed or a developing country, a large corporation or a small organization, coercion is always the option for the US, as long as the US considers it profitable and the targets won\'t bend to the will of the US. The US, under the banner of ""promoting democracy,"" carried out the ""Neo-Monroe Doctrine"" in Latin America, provoked the ""color revolution"" in Eurasia, and planned the ""Arab Spring"" in West Asia and North Africa. US political coercion measures form an endless stream. The US uses its military bases, diplomatic agencies, intelligence agencies, non-governmental organizations, media organizations and other channels and resources according to different targets and situations-collecting information, exerting influence, creating public opinions, manipulating elections, supporting opposition parties, etc. to publicly and secretly, directly and indirectly, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. A powerful military supports US in coercive diplomacy. The United States frequently utilizes military coercion and wanton use of force in international relations. In recent years, the average annual military budget of the United States has exceeded $700 billion, accounting for 40% of the world's total and exceeding the sum of the next 15 countries combined. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, and it often relies on arms trafficking to boost revenue and provoke regional conflicts. US military facilities and personnel are located in all corners and key areas of the globe. According to a 2020 report on US overseas military bases, the US has more than 800 military bases around the world, with 173,000 people deployed in 159 countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and beyond. The US frequently uses military force to initiate or participate in wars and conflicts of all sizes and forms. Between 1776 and 2019, the US conducted nearly 400 military interventions worldwide, half of which occurred between 1950 and 2019, according to the Tufts University report, ""Introducing the Military Intervention Project: A New Dataset on US Military Interventions."" After World War II, major wars initiated or launched by the US include the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the Afghan War, the Iraq War, the Libyan War and the Syrian War. Proxy wars are a common form of US military interventions, with countries such as Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Pakistan and Yemen suffering. According to the ""Cost of War"" project data of the Watson Institute at Brown University, conservative estimates show that the total number of military and civilian deaths caused by the US wars in the ""post-9/11 era"" is as high as 929,000, with at least 38 million people displaced. The soft powers of culture and science and technology are the covert means for the US to engage in ideological infiltration and coercive diplomacy. The US-led Western media and international social media have forcefully propped up and supported US coercive diplomacy. The US pursues double standards on freedom of the press and uses various means to smear and suppress foreign media outlets. The US abused its cultural hegemony, invested heavily in the media sector, supported its infiltration of ideas into other countries, and carried out inflammatory propaganda. Moreover, the US is used to fabricating false information to attack other countries, and peddling misleading public opinion globally using a purposefully built industrial chain. The United States uses its cultural products to promote American values. Hollywood films account for more than 70% of the world's market share. The values and lifestyle of the US are closely linked to its films and television programs, publications, media content, and programs of government-funded nonprofit cultural institutions, shaping a space for public opinion that sustains American cultural hegemony. It has seriously eroded the independence of other cultures and the diversity of world cultures. US intelligence agencies have established a large number of ""infiltration organizations"" around the world. Various foundations and non-governmental organizations have become ""middlemen"" in exporting American values and ""pioneers"" in cultural infiltration. The National Endowment for Democracy, the Congress for Cultural Freedom and other American ""infiltration organizations"" and institutions have promoted American cultural and political views to other countries through financial support, training, publication and conference, to export American values and ideology to the world, and to pursue cultural hegemony. III. The United States' coercive diplomacy endangers the whole world Distorting the underlying theme of our times of peace and development. Peace and development, as the theme of our times, are the common cause for people of all countries around the world. The pursuit of peace is the eternal ideal and wish of mankind, and economic globalization is the realistic precondition of world peace. However, in recent years, under the guidance of the concept of ""America First,"" US hegemony, unilateralism, protectionism, isolationism and nationalism has become increasingly fierce. The US, taking its own interests first, disregards the urgent needs of all countries in the world for peace and development. It is keen to manipulate ideological issues, engage in zero-sum games, and set up various geographical ""small cliques."" The US coercive diplomacy has cast a shadow over the cause of global peace and development by instigating ""color revolutions"" in the world, pouring oil over fire and seeking interests from geopolitical struggles. Disrupting the process of economic globalization and regional economic integration. Increasingly engaging in economic coercion around the world, the US has seriously undermined economic globalization and regional economic integration, resulting in the artificial segmentation and further fragmentation of the world economy. This has seriously reversed the course of economic globalization. In order to maintain its hegemony, the US is withdrawing from the pattern of global cooperation formed after World War II and has actually become the biggest disruptor of the rules of globalization. The WTO was almost paralyzed by US inaction, and the trend of global trade and investment liberalization and integration was blocked and undermined by the US. The US economic coercion has not only undermined global supply chains and industrial chains based on factor endowments and comparative advantages, reducing labor productivity, but also raised regional and even global production costs and hindered the process of regional economic integration. Hindering the development of emerging economies and developing countries represented by the BRICS countries. The economic sanctions and blockade imposed by the United States on developing countries such as Venezuela, Cuba, Myanmar and Syria have directly interrupted the sustainable development process of these countries. In these countries, the vast majority of the 17 goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the eradication of all forms of poverty throughout the world, the eradication of hunger, the realization of sustainable economic growth, sustainable industrialization, the reduction of inequality within and between countries, and sustainable cities and human settlements have been put out of reach by US coercion, and the cause of global development has repeatedly been frustrated. Economic sanctions imposed by the US on the BRICS countries, namely, China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa and emerging markets such as Argentina, Mexico and Turkey have severely harmed their economic interests. Intensifying division and antagonism in the international community. In order to maintain its global hegemony and contain the development of other countries, the US is keen to force other countries to join the ""democratic alliance"" by means of drawing ideological lines and imposing tariffs. Using the Ukraine crisis, the US rallies the European Union and other developed countries to join in on the sanctions against Russia, and coerces developing countries to take sides. It coerces European allies to join the US in continuing to impose sanctions on Iran, which has severely affected the livelihood and economic development of Iran. What the US has done has intensified the antagonism in the international community and raised the risk of the world falling into a new Cold War. Conclusion The United States is the inventor and master of coercive diplomacy. For a long time, the US, through various rogue means such as economic blockade, unilateral sanctions, military threats, political isolation, and technical blockade, has presented textbook cases of coercive diplomacy to the world. As US scholars have pointed out, the essence of US coercive diplomacy lies in the idea that ""you are either with us or against us. The US should lead, and its allies should follow, and the countries that oppose the supremacy of the US will suffer."" Shrugging off the fact that the US itself has engaged in coercive diplomacy everywhere, the US, out of political self-interest, readily tags China and other countries with the label of coercive diplomacy. It needs to be pointed out that an important tradition in China's diplomacy is to uphold the equality of all countries large and small, and never to divide the world into different groups or engage in the practice of coercion and bullying. Moreover, China has always taken a clear-cut stand against hegemony, unilateralism and coercive diplomacy. China never threatens other countries with force. China never forms military coalition or exports ideology. China never makes provocations at others' doorstep or reaches its hands into others' homes. China never wages trade wars or groundlessly hobbles foreign companies. To slander China for engaging in the so-called coercive diplomacy is obviously just making trumped-up charges. The international community can easily tell who is engaging in coercive diplomacy and who is coercing the whole world.

[Photo/Agencies]']",2023-05-19 07:30,China Daily,"This text is an opinion piece written by Liu Hanque, a Chinese diplomat, criticizing the US's approach to foreign policy, particularly under the Trump administration. Here are some key points from the essay:

1. **Coercive diplomacy as a US strategy**: The author argues that the US has adopted a ""coercive diplomacy"" approach, which aims to impose its will on other countries through various means, such as economic sanctions, military threats, and diplomatic isolation.
2. **Lack of moral integrity**: Liu Hanque accuses the US of engaging in coercive diplomacy not only for self-interest but also for ideological reasons, implying that it has no qualms about using force or intimidation to achieve its goals.
3. **China's position on coercion**: The author contrasts China's approach with that of China, which has always sought to uphold the equality and non-interference principle in foreign affairs, avoiding coercion and bullying.
4. **The US's history of aggression**: Liu Hanque notes that the US has a long history of aggressive behavior towards other countries, including Japan during World War II and Vietnam in the 1960s.
5. **China's response to US aggression**: The author argues that China will not engage in coercive diplomacy or threaten others with force, but instead seeks to maintain peace through diplomacy and dialogue.

Some key phrases from the essay include:

* ""The essence of US coercive diplomacy lies in the idea that 'you are either with us or against us'.""
* ""Shrugging off the fact that the US itself has engaged in coercive diplomacy everywhere.""
* ""To slander China for engaging in the so-called coercive diplomacy is obviously just making trumped-up charges.""
* ""Those who engage in coercion, sanctions, bullying, suppressing other countries and bringing chaos to the world, will eventually hurt themselves.""

Overall, this essay presents a critical view of US foreign policy, suggesting that it prioritizes self-interest over moral principles and has engaged in coercive diplomacy throughout history.","The article highlights several key issues with US foreign policy, particularly in terms of its approach to global governance and the use of coercive diplomacy. Here are some of the main points:

1. **Unilateralism**: The author argues that the US has been pursuing an ""America First"" approach, disregarding the interests of other countries and engaging in unilateral actions such as economic sanctions, military interventions, and diplomatic isolation.
2. **Use of coercion**: The article criticizes the US for using coercive diplomacy to pressure other countries into doing its bidding. This can include imposing tariffs, sanctions, and trade restrictions on certain nations.
3. **Failure to engage in dialogue**: Despite being a global superpower, the US has largely failed to engage in meaningful dialogue with other nations, particularly in areas such as climate change, economic development, and security.
4. **Polarization of international relations**: The article suggests that the US's approach to foreign policy is contributing to increased polarization between the US and other countries, particularly China and Russia.
5. **Disregard for international law**: The author notes that the US has been willing to disregard international law in pursuit of its own interests, using tactics such as economic sanctions and military interventions to achieve its goals.

The article also highlights several key characteristics of coercive diplomacy:

1. **Divisive rhetoric**: The use of divisive language by the US can create tensions and escalate conflicts between nations.
2. **Lack of transparency**: Coercive diplomatic efforts often involve secretive or opaque actions, making it difficult for other countries to understand the motivations behind them.
3. **Disregard for sovereignty**: The US has been willing to disregard the sovereignty of other countries in pursuit of its own interests.

Overall, the article concludes that the US's approach to foreign policy is contributing to increased tensions and instability in international relations, and that it is essential for the world to adopt a more collaborative and inclusive approach to global governance."

Established initially as a group of rapidly developing economies, BRICS has evolved beyond its economic roots into a platform for political and strategic collaboration. The group's growing influence allows it to assume a pivotal role in promoting global stability, mutual prosperity, sustainable development and multilateral global governance. The 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, reaffirms the group's commitment to reinforcing multilateralism and enhancing South-South cooperation. While the grouping is diverse in its geopolitical outlook and economic models, it addresses global inequities by presenting a unified front to achieve a fairer, more balanced world order. The Kazan summit introduced several notable initiatives designed to drive global stability, economic cooperation and sustainable development. One of the most groundbreaking developments was the decision to build BRICS partner countries while welcoming potential new members. The New Development Bank, a key financial initiative by BRICS, has been strengthened with plans to expand its membership and extend financial support to emerging economies. The bank's focus remains on financing infrastructure and sustainable development projects. The bank provides much-needed funding for developing countries with fewer political strings attached. In an effort to reduce dependency on the United States dollar, BRICS leaders discussed measures to promote transactions in local currencies. This initiative aligns with major developing and emerging market economies' long-term aspiration of diversifying international currency settlements and facilitating trade and investment across BRICS nations. If successful, this strategy could lessen the impact of currency fluctuations, reduce the risk of US-imposed economic sanctions and empower developing economies to exercise greater control over their financial systems. The summit also emphasized collaboration in technology, digital transformation and innovation. Recognizing the transformative power of technology, BRICS seeks partnerships in these areas to bridge the digital divide, enable knowledge exchange, and create job opportunities within member nations. China, with its strengths in digital technology and telecommunications, plays a leading role in this agenda, enabling BRICS countries to harness the benefits of technological advancements for economic growth. The commitment to combating climate change was another critical theme. The BRICS summit reaffirmed its dedication to green energy initiatives and sustainable development projects. China's green technology advancements, particularly in renewable energy, are pivotal to shaping this agenda. Together, the BRICS nations aim to use their resources sustainably, achieving greener economic growth, reducing carbon emissions and contributing to a healthier planet. China's economic prowess has positioned itself as the primary driver of BRICS' economic agenda. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, China has extended its infrastructure investments to other BRICS nations, promoting trade, improving connectivity and creating opportunities for mutually beneficial partnerships. Its leadership lends stability to BRICS, reinforcing the group's potential as an economic powerhouse capable of influencing global markets. China's diplomatic efforts have long emphasized multilateralism and collaboration over confrontation. Within BRICS, China actively supports South-South cooperation, which includes development assistance, technology transfer and capacity building among developing countries. By facilitating dialogue and cooperation, China strengthens BRICS' collective bargaining power on global issues, from trade regulations to climate commitments. China's soft power within and beyond BRICS is evident through its emphasis on technology and green development. Its advancements in renewable energy, digital transformation and technological innovation enable other BRICS nations to make strides toward sustainable development. This collaborative approach to problem-solving strengthens BRICS, creating opportunities for shared progress and growth. For the world at large, BRICS' rise brings hope for a more equitable distribution of power. The inclusion of new members from Africa and the Middle East signifies BRICS' intention to be a global force, with representation beyond the traditional confines of economic powerhouses. China's leadership and commitment to fair, inclusive development ensure BRICS is well-positioned to foster an environment where diverse voices and interests are respected, potentially reducing conflicts stemming from economic and political exclusion. In an increasingly polarized world, BRICS emerges as a beacon of collaboration and inclusivity, with China playing a pivotal role in steering the group toward its ambitious goals. Through its recent activities, BRICS demonstrates that the current global order can  and must  be reformed to address the needs and aspirations of all nations, particularly those in the Global South. As BRICS continues to expand its influence, its model of partnership and cooperation offers a hopeful vision for a world where nations stand as equals, free from the shackles of unipolar domination. The impact of BRICS, underpinned by China's balanced leadership, marks a significant step toward realizing a multipolar, harmonious global order that benefits all.

Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates were formally welcomed into the BRICS' fold on Jan 1. For those countries longing for a fair and just world order  especially the countries of the Global South such as Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Syria, Belarus and Pakistan which want to join the grouping  the summit in Kazan might open new channels to contribute to the cause of BRICS and enjoy the benefits of being a member of it. It is the BRICS member states' technological progress, huge development potential, and common commitment to multilateralism  BRICS contributed more than 40 percent to global economic growth in the past decade  that have made the grouping capable of efficiently promoting the reform of the global governance system and clearing the bottlenecks that obstruct their respective development path and hinder common development. Apart from trying to establish a more inclusive international financial settlement system to reduce the US dollar's dominance in global trade, the BRICS members are also building new and more cohesive communication channels and developing mechanisms that would sustain long-term investment, which are likely to be the subjects of discussion in Kazan. That more than 30 countries and regions, including non-BRICS members, are taking part in the meeting shows the grouping's agenda is conducive to meeting their needs. But for countries trying to portray their ""rules-based world order"" as best suited to good global governance, particularly those that have been benefiting from the world order they built and BRICS Plus is trying to reform, the meeting in Kazan is like a thorn in their side. The fact, however, is that the increasingly important roles BRICS and its member states are playing on the world stage have cheesed off the big cheese, which for long has taken it for granted that it will always be a winner-takes-it-all world. The developed world has now adopted a more vigilant approach toward BRICS because the grouping is not what they had thought it to be  an empty talk shop  but a resolute executor of plans and projects. However, given the rise of hegemony, protectionism, unilateralism and bloc confrontation, and the efforts of some countries to drag the world into a new Cold War, BRICS should firmly resist the acts that undermine the world order, and focus on helping build a truly equal and multipolar world. The BRICS member states, in the process, should strengthen their coordination and cooperation with the rest of the Global South. Besides, BRICS should safeguard food and energy security, and oppose the politicization and weaponization of food and energy issues, explore the possibility of establishing an inclusive supply and demand system, and industry and supply chains. The grouping, with members like China, Russia and India, has the capability and means to lead a technological revolution by strengthening intra-BRICS cooperation and promoting innovation in the fields of artificial intelligence, new industrialization, deep-sea resource exploration, digital education and connectivity, and should consider doing so. Since the inception of BRICS, the member states have been committed to upholding multilateralism and becoming a positive, stabilizing and benevolent force in international relations.

13,Beijing and Islamabad building a community with a shared future,"('Pakistan', 'Pakistani', 'CPEC')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202406\06\WS6660f558a31082fc043cb209.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/06/WS6660f558a31082fc043cb209.html,"The ongoing five-day visit of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to China from Tuesday marks a significant moment in the longstanding and robust partnership between the two countries. This visit, the first by Sharif since the new Pakistani government took office, underscores the deep-rooted ties and strategic cooperation that characterize the relationship between the two neighbors. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind, championed by China, finds a tangible embodiment in its relationship with Pakistan, reflecting a partnership built on mutual respect, strategic alignment, and shared aspirations for regional and global peace and prosperity. Given the significance of Sharif\'s visit, it is important to consider the historical context and the strategic depth of China-Pakistan relations. Over the years, Sino-Pakistani relations have evolved into an ""all-weather strategic cooperative partnership"", a term that aptly captures the essence of their ties. Whether in times of peace or crisis, China and Pakistan have stood by each other, demonstrating mutual support and cooperation. Sharif\'s visit therefore is expected to further consolidate this partnership, with both sides poised to discuss a range of issues crucial to bilateral relations as well as regional stability. One of the key aspects of Sharif's visit is the discussion on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. Launched in 2013, the CPEC has been instrumental in transforming Pakistan's economic landscape. It has led to significant infrastructure development, including the construction and development of roads, highways, power plants and ports, which are aimed at addressing Pakistan's critical energy shortage and improving connectivity. During the visit, both sides are likely to explore ways to further upgrade and expand CPEC, ensuring that it continues to contribute to Pakistan's economic growth, industrialization and sustainable development. In addition to infrastructure, the focus will also be on enhancing cooperation in other key areas such as industry, agriculture, new energy and information and communications technology. China's commitment to sharing its technological advancements and expertise with Pakistan is a testament to the collaborative spirit that underpins their relationship. This cooperation is aimed at not only boosting economic growth but also fostering innovation and sustainable development in Pakistan. In fact, by aligning their development strategies, China and Pakistan are setting an example of how strategic partnerships can drive progress and prosperity. Security cooperation is another crucial area that will be high on the agenda during Sharif's visit to China. The recent terrorist attacks targeting Chinese nationals in Pakistan have highlighted the importance of enhanced security measures to protect both Chinese and Pakistani citizens involved in CPEC projects. Both countries are committed to deepening cooperation in the fight against terrorism, ensuring that such incidents do not derail their collaborative efforts. China's unwavering support for Pakistan's fight against terrorism and its efforts to maintain regional stability are indicative of the strong trust and strategic alignment between the two countries. Sharif's visit to China comes at a time when regional and global dynamics are rapidly evolving. The geopolitical landscape in South Asia is marked by complexities and challenges, and the China-Pakistan partnership plays a crucial role in maintaining regional stability. Both countries share a common vision for peace and development, and their coordinated efforts in multilateral forums such as the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization reflect their commitment to upholding fairness and justice on global issues. Sharif's visit is also expected to strengthen people-to-people relations between the two countries, which are a cornerstone of China-Pakistan relations. Cultural exchanges, educational collaboration and tourism are areas that hold immense potential for deepening mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries. These interactions not only foster goodwill but also build a strong foundation for long-term cooperation. And the emphasis on cultural and educational exchanges is a testament to the holistic approach that both countries adopt in nurturing their relationship. As a matter of fact, the significance of Sharif's ongoing visit extends beyond bilateral cooperation. It is a reaffirmation of the strategic importance that both countries place on their relationship. The high-level meetings scheduled during Sharif's visit will provide an opportunity for the two sides to engage in comprehensive and in-depth strategic communication. Such interactions are essential for aligning the two countries' visions and strategies, and ensuring their partnership continues to thrive in a rapidly changing world. Moreover, this visit is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of China-Pakistan relations. Despite the challenges posed by global and regional issues and the growing uncertainties, created by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic and terrorism, both countries have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to adapt to the changing times and cooperate on critical issues. The successful implementation of CPEC projects during these challenging times is a reflection of the two countries' commitment and strategic foresight. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind is best exemplified by the ironclad partnership between China and Pakistan, a partnership that continues to thrive and evolve, bringing greater benefits to both countries and their peoples.

14,Beijing subway system is a lifeline for the city,"('Pakistani',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202403\13\WS65f0f84da31082fc043bc4b9.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202403/13/WS65f0f84da31082fc043bc4b9.html,"The Beijing subway system continues to be a beacon of efficiency and convenience for millions of commuters, significantly improving their daily commute and enhancing overall quality of life. The Beijing underground system was established in 1971 and has grown significantly since then. It now connects many different areas of the city with a vast network. With around 27 lines, comprising over 490 stations, two airport rail links, one maglev line, two light rail lines and 22 rapid transit lines, the system spans over 12 urban and suburban districts in Beijing, as well as one district in Langfang in the neighboring province of Hebei, for a total distance of around 836 kilometers. A research states that 3.84 billion journeysor 10.54 million trips every daywere undertaken in 2018. The Beijing subway stands as one of the longest and busiest subway systems globally. The Beijing underground system's ability to reduce traffic congestion, a recurring problem in the busy city, is among its most important advantages. The underground system dramatically lowers the number of cars on the road, improving traffic flow and making the environment cleaner by offering a dependable substitute for private transportation. Furthermore, anyone from all social classes can use the tube because of its affordability and efficiency, regardless of their financial situation. The underground continues to be a popular option for everyday commuters, infrequent travelers, and visitors from all over the world because of its affordable costs and variety of ticketing options, which include single trips and reduced monthly passes. I recall how far the Beijing Institute of Technology's Liangxiang campus is from the city center from my time there. The Fangshan line metro, another branch of the extensive Beijing subway system, is one that I used to travel on with ease. It not only provided me a simple and pleasant way to travel, but it also made it easier for me to reach my destination on time. Remember that the cost of transportation in Beijing is rather low. Now that I'm on the Zhonguancun campus of BIT, I have two options for transportation Line 4 and Line 16, which are the closest to the main campus of the universityso it's much more convenient for me to use them. The Beijing underground system is more than simply a way of getting around for many residents; it's their lifeline, linking them to opportunities, conveniences, and services that are vital. The subway's reach makes it easier to connect and move throughout the city, whether it's for pleasure or visiting cultural sites and job prospects located around the city. Moreover, the Beijing metro system is essential to improving urban accessibility for people with impairments. With features such as tactile paving, priority seating, and elevators that remove barriers, it guarantees inclusivity and equitable access for all travelers, regardless of their physical capabilities. Also, according to a news release of the 2024 Beijing Urban Rail Transit Construction Plan, the first phases of Line 3 (Dongsishitiao-Dongfeng), Line 12 (Sijiqingqiao-Dongfeng), and the remaining portion of Phase I of Changping Line's south extension line (Xitucheng-Jimenqiao) will all begin operations this year. According to reports, together these projects will cover a distance of about 45.3 kilometers. After that, Beijing's urban rail system will operate over 880 kilometers in length. Ten stations in total, including six transfer stations, will be part of Line 3's Phase I (Dongsishitiao-Dongfeng). There will be 13 transfer stations among the 20 stations of Line 12 (Sijigingqiao-Dongfeng). Passengers will have transfer choices for the remaining 12 subway lines, including Lines 4 and 5, once it is finished and operational. For the remaining portion of Changping Line's Phase I south extension line (Xitucheng-Jimenqiao), one more station and an additional interval will be constructed. When the line is completed and operational, it will be fully connected, facilitating easier transit for the local population. The underground system is proof of Beijing's dedication to sustainable urban development and modernization as the city continues to develop into a major international centre of business, culture, and innovation. The future of Beijing's underground system appears brighter than ever, with plans for continual growth and technical breakthroughs that promise benefits for future generations. In summary, the Beijing underground system improves the lives of millions of residents and tourists every day by revolutionizing transportation and acting as a catalyst for advancement.

2. Implied Motives: The primary motive appears to be promoting the Beijing underground system and its benefits, which are presented as fact rather than opinion. The author presents statistics and quotes from research studies to support their claims.

3. Subtle Implications: Loaded terms like ""beacon of efficiency"" and ""lifeblood"" suggest a positive bias towards the underground system. The use of phrases like ""drastically lowering traffic congestion"" implies that the system is a panacea for urban problems, which may not be entirely accurate.

4. Intended Audience Impact: The article aims to instill trust in its readers by presenting evidence-based claims and statistics. However, the inclusion of personal anecdotes (""I recall how far..."") may create an impression of objectivity when it's clear that the author is promoting a particular viewpoint.

5. Summary:
The Beijing underground system is described as a vital lifeline for millions of residents and tourists, with its expansion planned to cover over 880 kilometers in length. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of sustainable urban development and modernization in Beijing."
15,Books explore ancient Greek influences on Asia and emerging Silk Road,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\05\WS67294acba310f1265a1cb62c.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/05/WS67294acba310f1265a1cb62c.html,"Some 2,100 to 1,800 years ago in what is today's northwestern Pakistan, the Gandharan civilization produced sculptures of Buddha and other Buddhist figures with the features of Greek gods wrapped in aristocratic robes. The Gandhara art persisted until the 7th century and had some influence on the Buddhist sculptures seen in China and other East Asian countries. ""The Buddhist art of Gandhara has amazed and puzzled modern observers since its rediscovery in the 19th century, for the artists of Gandhara  took imagery and styles that ultimately originated in ancient Greece, and they made them Buddhist and Asian, and thereby introduced them into the later traditions of Chinese Buddhist art,"" says Peter Stewart, professor of ancient art and director of the Classical Art Research Centre at the University of Oxford. ""They, and that story (of Gandhara), are emblematic of the fascinating filaments that run through all the periods and places explored in this publication,"" Stewart says, speaking of the six-volume publication of From Mediterranean to the Yellow River: Hellenistic Civilization and the Silk Road , via video during the book\'s signing ceremony for the production of an English version at this year\'s Frankfurt Book Fair in October. Stewart is coeditor of the fourth volume, From Apollo to Buddha: Hellenistic Art and the Silk Road Arts , which deals with the dissemination and fusion of art, and which according to him, ""traces Western classical art traditions from its Greek origins, looking at how it was disseminated and transformed in the Hellenistic world, how it became the heritage of the Roman Empire, and how it eventually became deeply embedded in the cultures of Central Asia and the steppe"". Stewart is among the 40-odd researchers and contributors from across the world, who spent almost 10 years finishing the interdisciplinary studies, which were published by the Zhonghua Book Company as a series of books containing around 1,500 pictures. ""The project was vast, but at its heart was a simple proposition  that two distinct areas (the Hellenistic civilization and the Silk Road) of study were intimately connected and could usefully be researched and explained alongside each other,"" Stewart says. ""Hellenistic civilization and the Silk Road seem to be two unrelated research fields, but in fact, there is an intrinsic logical relationship between them,"" says Yang Juping, the book\'s chief editor and a leading professor of Hellenism at Nankai University. Yang says that the vast empire established by Alexander the Great, and the Hellenistic world he created that extended from the Mediterranean to Central Asia and the borders of India, laid the foundation for the opening of the Silk Road later on. Meanwhile, the ambitions of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) rulers to manage the western regions of their territory and the ""exploration"" of Central Asia by Zhang Qian ushered in a new era of cultural exchange and mutual learning between the Chinese and Hellenistic civilizations. ""The series is one of the first comprehensive studies of the relationship between the Hellenistic civilization and the Silk Road in China and abroad,"" Yang says, adding that the perspective the book brings opens up a new field of research, and has allowed the voices of Chinese scholars to be heard on a global stage on matters that were little known or long disputed. Each volume has a specific theme, but they are interconnected, and examine the general picture, the historical background, the cities, the currencies and the economic overview of the two areas, along with the Hellenistic heritage in China and along the Silk Road. The publishing group Springer Nature will serve as an amplifier of these voices by bringing the series to a wider international audience with an English version. ""Today, we are not just releasing a book series, but also launching a dialogue that spans continents and centuries,"" says Niels Peter Thomas, Springer Nature\'s managing director for books. Zhang Jihai, deputy editor-in-chief of the Zhonghua Book Company, believes that the series will provide valuable historical references for the Belt and Road Initiative, and be a delight to general readers, providing a glimpse of the overall picture of ancient cultural exchanges between China and the West.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/05/67294acba310f1268d8432c6.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/05/67294acba310f1268d8432c8.jpeg']","['The signing ceremony between the Zhonghua Book Company and Springer Nature at Frankfurt Book Fair on Oct 17.\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily]', 'The book cover of the series in Chinese.\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily]']",2024-11-05 06:29,Mei Jia,"- **Main Topics:**

For the 21-year-old ""B-girl"" the prospect is bittersweet. ""I would love to go and compete with the Afghan team alongside other girls, but we all know that\'s just impossible,"" Talash told reporters as she got ready to train in a public square in Madrid\'s Vallecas neighborhood. ""I\'m very happy, because, a few months ago, it was just a dream, but now I\'m living it. I can look at myself and say that \'I\'m here, I\'ve made it\'."" Breaking, a competitive form of street dance that blends artistry and dance with acrobatic moves, will make its debut at the Paris Olympics in July. Sixteen B-girls and 16 B-boys will compete in the discipline, which has its roots in the New York Bronx of the 1970s, bringing a new dimension to the Olympic movement. ""When I saw a video online of a man just spinning on his head, I immediately told myself: \'That\'s what I want to do with my life!\' And, three months later, I found a gym in Kabul to start training,"" Talash recalled. As the only girl among the 56 members of the Superiors Crew, a small but ardent breaking community in Kabul, Talash said it was not only her family members who disapproved of her new passion. She started receiving death threats as the word spread about Afghanistan's first B-girl. Many conservative Afghans frown on dancing of any kind, and even more vehemently object to a woman's public participation  some of them violently so. ""We received three bomb threats to our club and, after the police came and arrested a man who was planning to attack us, they ordered us to close the club down, because they said it was a major threat not only to ourselves, but for the people in the neighborhood,"" Talash said. Then, in August 2021, the Taliban took control of Kabul, outlawing music and dancing, which the group considers to be ""un-Islamic"". Since then, most girls have been barred from high school and women from universities. The Taliban have also stopped most Afghan female staff from working at aid agencies, closed beauty salons, barred women from parks and curtailed travel for women in the absence of a male guardian. ""After the Taliban came, I didn\'t leave Afghanistan because of the fear of death. It was because breaking is my life. I\'m here now because I have chosen to pursue my dream."" Talash said that she spent a year in Pakistan before being granted refugee status in Spain, alongside six other members of her crew who were spread around the country. She kept training, but it wasn't until early 2024 that, thanks to the efforts of friends, the Refugee Olympic Team found Talash, brought her to Madrid and sponsored her six-days-a-week training program after she secured her spot at the Paris Olympics. Around the same time, her mother, two brothers and sister were granted refugee status, and were able to join her in Madrid, giving Talash an extra shot of energy. ""I feel that, by doing what I\'m doing, I\'m doing something for the women in Afghanistan. For my girls there. I don\'t want to just talk, I want to go out there and do something. To walk the walk,"" she said.

17,CPEC security key to Sino-Pakistani ironclad relations,"('Pakistan', 'Pakistani', 'Gwadar', 'Islamabad', 'Balochistan', 'Punjab', 'CPEC')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202405\15\WS6643ee68a31082fc043c716d.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202405/15/WS6643ee68a31082fc043c716d.html,"While the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects have yielded tangible benefits for the local economy and its people, recent attacks targeting the CPEC should serve as a cause for serious concern. Despite the enduring ironclad friendship between the two nations, the security issue must be prioritized. The killing of seven workers in the Pakistani coastal city of Gwadar in Balochistan province on May 9 hit the headlines around the world. A few weeks earlier, 11 people were shot dead in two separate incidents in Balochistan. The fact that all the seven victims in Gwadar and the nine bus passengers who were gunned down near Noshki were from Punjab province adds an ethnic dimension to the incidents, especially because the Baloch Liberation Army, designated a terror group, has been openly threatening to target people from Punjab. However, this viewpoint is too simplistic because Pakistan is facing a multidimensional terrorist threat. In the context of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and its extraordinary importance for Balochistan, Gwadar in particular, and Chinese nationals working on projects there, it would not be wrong to say the killings are a continuation of the attempts to create instability in Pakistan to check the progress of the CPEC and damage China-Pakistan relations. On March 26, five Chinese nationals and a Pakistani citizen were killed in a suicide attack on a vehicle carrying Chinese staff working on the Dasu Dam in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Similar attacks happened in 2021 and 2022, too. Each of these incidents has its own specific dynamics, with the identity and motivation of the perpetrators and facilitators varying. However, given the current global and regional situations, it wouldn't be wrong to assume that the masterminds of the attacks want to cause instability in Pakistan. Their other objectives include derailing the CPEC projects and straining Sino-Pakistani ties. While these incidents attract global attention, they cause severe concerns in China, undermining its confidence in investing in development projects in Pakistan, eroding the trust between the two governments and weakening the spirit of Chinese investors and workers engaged in Pakistan. Beijing\'s reaction to the incidents has been firm. After the March 26 Dasu attack, Beijing called for a ""thorough investigation"", insisting on forming a joint investigation team. The Chinese embassy in Islamabad demanded that Pakistan take practical and effective measures to improve the situation. Although it was reassuring to see the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson emphasize that as all-weather strategic cooperative partners, China and Pakistan\'s cooperation cannot be sabotaged by any attempt, several Chinese companies suspended work on their projects. They resumed operations only after security was beefed up and the Pakistani prime minister visited the Chinese workers at the Dasu site and promised to make ""foolproof"" security arrangements and hand down ""exemplary punishment"" to the attackers. There is no doubt there have been administrative failures and security lapses, and strict measures are required at every level to safeguard China-Pakistan interests and, most importantly, protect human lives. As such, a comprehensive joint strategy is needed to address the situation. Security issues are not a new phenomenon in Pakistan, and there are many internal, regional and international reasons for that. As a matter of fact, terrorism attacks were more frequent and deadly when the CPEC was negotiated and launched. Nevertheless, the two countries agreed to launch the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative because of their mutual trust and a desire to achieve common development. In the years that followed, Pakistan achieved remarkable success in curbing terrorism, but could not uproot all terrorist groups. In fact, the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 made the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, an amalgam of several terrorist groups, even stronger thanks to the release of prisoners and terrorists getting access to the sophisticated weapons and equipment left behind by the Americans. Although there is little common between the Afghan Taliban and Baloch terrorist organizations, the room for cooperation with various elements of the TTP at the tactical level has increased compared with the past. On the other hand, with polarization and instability being at their peak in Pakistan, economic, security and social vulnerabilities have increased, creating governance issues and slowing the pace of the CPEC projects. Apart from creating a favorable environment for terrorist outfits, the situation has also made it easy for outsiders to interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs, especially to sabotage the CPEC projects and ruin Pakistan-China friendship in order to fulfill their own narrow goals. Despite the evil designs of the anti-Pakistan and anti-China forces, however, the Chinese and Pakistani peoples' opinions about each other remain positive. In the case of Pakistan, where almost everything is debated, successive public opinion surveys and political discourse verify this fact. There is indeed a need to ensure the safety of workers and projects by strengthening security and taking administrative measures, but those moves should be accompanied by a comprehensive strategy in order to maintain an environment of mutual trust at the public and government levels.

18,Change of ways,"('Pakistani',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202409\19\WS66eb5ea8a3103711928a887e.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/19/WS66eb5ea8a3103711928a887e.html,"It may be rapid, immediate or slow, but change is inevitable. Changes in Asia in terms of politics and economics are multi-dimensional. It gives the Asian political landscape a unique character. The modern thought of politics, efficient economic theory, advanced social science and forward-looking science and technology are the real strengths of Asia. In recent years, the world has been confronted with a series of serious crises and challenges, including the Ukraine crisis, United States-China tensions, the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh and Myanmar, the turmoil in Pakistani politics, and the Afghan crisis. Each of these changes has had a significant economic and political impact on Asia, and on the whole world as well. In October 2022, US President Joe Biden took a major step to try and constrain China\'s rise by denying it access to the advanced semiconductor chips essential for the development of new technology such as artificial intelligence. However, the administration\'s tendency to act unilaterally, its lackluster trade initiatives, and its embrace of an industrial policy that could steal jobs from those same friends and allies, have undercut its efforts. In mid-November 2023, President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the G20 summit. They agreed to work to reduce mutual tensions and pledged cooperation in areas such as climate change and public health. Nonetheless, mutual suspicion and acrimony are likely to dominate the relationship for years to come. If we analyze the above-mentioned statement of the US government, we will find the root cause of the ongoing challenges to the ""Rise of Asia"". Instead of embracing the concept of shared development as strongly promoted by President Xi, the US has preferred to take a controversial approach toward China and other major Asian powers. This approach is neither peace-loving nor democratic and not in line with a responsible diplomatic manner. The peace-loving citizens of the US will not welcome the approach that is clearly directed at a hegemonic world order. Rather the global community requires a world of mutual cooperation. Once the narrative of development was subject to the prescription of a bipolar world order. Now the global scenario has been transformed to a complex and multidimensional level. President Xi in his keynote address at the opening ceremony of the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing on Sept 5, rightly said: ""Modernization is an inalienable right of all countries."" In his speech, he pointed out that the wave of modernization underway must be just and equitable and put people first. It must be open and win-win, and underpinned by peace and security. It must also be eco-friendly and featuring diversity and inclusiveness. These issues need to be addressed strongly in all aspects of regional and global development, particularly in the development paradigm of the Global South. As Harvard University Professor Stephen M. Walt wrote in Foreign Policy Journal on March 7, 2023, ""the Biden administration is striving for a unipolar order that no longer exists"". Those who promote a unipolar world order have failed to submit any reasonable arguments why there should not be a multipolar world. Not surprisingly, Russian and Chinese leaders have long expressed a desire for a more multipolar order, as have the leaders of emerging powers such as India and Brazil. More interestingly, so have important US allies. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroder warned of the ""undeniable danger"" of US unilateralism, and former French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine once declared, ""the entire foreign policy of France  is aimed at making the world of tomorrow composed of several poles, not just one"". We can understand that this realization has come from the dire consequences of Western capitalism and its negative prospects. That is why the idea introduced by President Xi for global modernization necessarily focuses on a multipolar world order, featuring the theory of diversity and inclusiveness as set out in the Global Civilization Initiative. Thousands of years of experience of human civilization show that only by enhancing people-to-people and cultural exchanges among various parts of the world, and championing mutual respect, inclusiveness and the peaceful coexistence of different civilizations can more fruitful outcomes under the Global Civilization Initiative be achieved. Asia has proved its capacity to lead the implementation of this initiative. Our era and our history are at a very critical juncture. Any mistakes as to understanding the demands of the era may lead to unbearable consequences. I come from a very beautiful country with the largest sea beach in the world and it has extraordinary friendship with the Chinese people. Presently, China is a major development partner of Bangladesh. Our people want that this process has to be continued without hesitation. We can confidently say that thousand years of our history has proved that mutual respect, inclusiveness and peaceful coexistence of different civilizations can bring about global prosperity and peace.

""Enhancing global transportation cooperation and promoting sustainable development is more critical now than ever to ensure the stability of global supply chains,"" said Vice-Premier He Lifeng, highlighting the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, extreme weather and aging infrastructure that threaten sustainable transportation efforts. He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the Global Sustainable Transport Forum, which kicked off in Beijing on Wednesday. Under the theme ""Sustainable Transport: Logistics Connecting the World,"" the two-day event, hosted by the Ministry of Transport, aims to foster international collaboration in transportation. He also reaffirmed China's commitment to increasing investment in transportation infrastructure to stimulate economic growth in impoverished regions. The country expressed its willingness to share successful experiences in rural road development and promote collaboration with other nations. The forum includes a plenary session, a ministerial forum and four thematic discussions. Key reports to be released during the forum include the Global Vision for Sustainable Transportation, the China Sustainable Transport Development Report (2023), the Global Sustainable Transport Development Research Report (2023) and the Global Best Practices Initiative for Sustainable Transportation. ""We believe that the implementation of reforms in the transportation sector will further enhance the quality of China\'s infrastructure and service capabilities, providing greater certainty and stability for international logistics supply chains,"" he said. ""We are eager to learn from other countries\' experiences and share our own reform practices."" The initiative for sustainable transportation has gained widespread recognition among international communities. The forum is incredibly valuable for the developing world because it fosters meaningful engagement among diverse audiences and participating countries, said Kim Young Tae, secretary-general of the International Transport Forum. He also noted the improvement of the air quality in Beijing, highlighting the Chinese government's strong efforts toward decarbonization and enhancing environmental conditions. Regarding sustainable transportation development, Kim noted the growing presence of electric vehicles in China, indicating a significant shift away from fossil fuel cars. Abdul Aleem Khan, federal minister of Pakistan's Communications, Privatization and Board of Investment, emphasized the need for improved connectivity between urban and rural areas, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan where inadequate rural roads hinder economic development and exacerbate inequality. ""Sustainable solutions must be reliable, affordable and environmentally friendly to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas,"" he added. Tanzania's Minister of Transport Makame Mnyaa Mbarawa noted the long-standing cooperation between China and Tanzania, particularly in transport infrastructure.

20,China supports real peace progress in Ukraine,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202406\05\WS665f9960a31082fc043cae41.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/05/WS665f9960a31082fc043cae41.html,"After more than two years of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Switzerland will host the ""Summit on Peace in Ukraine"" on June 15 and 16, hoping it would lay the groundwork for a peace process leading to the end of hostilities in Eurasia. To prevent any more casualties and economic damage, and eventually restore peace in Ukraine, China is willing to participate in all peace processes. In fact, Li Hui, China's special envoy for Eurasian Affairs, has shuttled three times between countries in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, severe challenges persist in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict and establishing lasting peace in the region. As such, China attaches great importance to the peace meeting in Switzerland, and has maintained close communication with Switzerland and other countries since the beginning of this year. However, it is imperative that both Russia and Ukraine take part in the peace meeting, because without their representatives, the ""peace conference"" would be meaningless. And global leaders should persuade Moscow and Kyiv to hold peace talks in order to resolve their disputes. That's why while communicating with Switzerland and other stakeholders, China had been advocating that all international peace meetings should have a three-point criterion: recognition of both Russia and Ukraine as parties to the conflict, participation of all stakeholders, and holding of fair discussions on all peace proposals. Surprisingly, Russia, despite being a direct party to the conflict, has not been invited to the so-called peace summit. If the peace conference is held without Russian participation, it would violate the basic principle of organizing a peace conference: presence of all parties to a conflict to negotiate peace. With only one party to the conflict, Ukraine, participating the peace conference will become a trial in absentia of the other party, Russia, making it impossible to enforce any resolution passed by the conference. As a matter of fact, the peace conference will be seen as a gathering of certain countries to help one party and against the other party. The peace conference is doomed not to peace, but further escalation of the conflict. Surprisingly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Singapore on June 1 to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue and deliver a speech, with the aim of inviting more individuals to the ""peace summit"". Surprisingly, even the United States may not be represented at the peace meeting by President Joe Biden. Instead, some lower-level officials are likely to participate in the so-called peace summit. So, although the organizers claim to have sent invitations to about 160 countries around the world, the number of countries actually participating in the meeting has been decreasing. For example, the major regional powers such as Brazil, South Africa, Pakistan and other countries will not participate. Hence, the so-called peace summit will not have the authority to pass a binding resolution to achieve its goals. The upcoming so-called peace summit has rejected the three-point criterion for the peace meeting, prompting China to say that the participants in the Switzerland meeting lack sincerity. China is a sovereign state and has its own cognition of facts, history and international relations. It is also fully aware of its international responsibilities. And it made its stance on the Ukraine crisis crystal clear, suggesting ways to help restore peace in Eurasia, in the position paper, ""China\'s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis"", it released on Feb 24, 2023. In the ""Common Understanding between China and Brazil on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis"", which the two countries signed on May 23, 2024, China reiterated its position on finding a peaceful, political solution to the Ukraine crisis. Choosing to be on the right side of history, China supports real peace progress and is opposed to playing games such as pretending to treat all parties equally and in a fair manner but doing just the opposite  by holding a trial in absentia. As for Ukraine, China respects its sovereignty and territorial integrity. With regard to Russia, China aims to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era based on the principles of non-confrontation, non-alignment, and non-targeting of third parties. Given its traditional status as a neutral country, Switzerland has been advocating neutrality and promoting peace. It is in this spirit that Switzerland organized the meeting to find ways to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. China fully understands and respects Switzerland's efforts to help resolve the conflict. Although China refuses to participate in the Switzerland peace meeting, it does not mean it has given up its position on brokering peace and promoting negotiations. China has made it clear that it will continue to promote the peace process in its own way, maintain communication with all parties, and accumulate conditions for a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis. China supports the efforts of parties, to peacefully settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But such peace summits are nothing but a mockery of international relations and farcical attempts to fool the world.

The report comes at a time when the Communist Party of China (CPC) has just concluded a third plenum with the theme of deepening reforms and opening up for the advancement of Chinese modernization. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also revised China's 2024 economic growth to be up to 5 percent, and in an update to its World Economic Outlook (WEO) from the 4.6 percent forecast in April. These updates have provided a solid foundation for achieving China's anticipated economic targets within the current year, sending a strong signal for the international community that the stable and the long-term development trajectory of China's economy will not be changed. The message now is loud and clear that China has been resolutely advancing its reforms, heralding an era of positive results. China has aggressively intensified its economic activities both domestically and in interactions with other nations, by relaxing and even abolishing restrictive policies. This helps attract foreign investments that helps maintain the momentum of economic growth. China has a conducive environment, capacity and commitment to foster economic activities domestically and globally with high-quality development and range. With the start of this year, everyone has witnessed the rise in global geographic political conflicts while in this scenario the ratio of China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has performed well compared to economies like the US, Eurozone and Japan and China is still the stable and strong engine of global economic growth with its performance in H1. China's economic progress is highlighting that the so-called Western theory of Chinese economic collapse has obviously failed while neither the American and EU tariffs, geographical punching, technological wars or trade conflicts have been able to block the high development progress of the country. Western countries have followed the footsteps of the United States in imposing additional trade barriers against China which have scrutinized the EU's trade activities and it has painted a gloomy picture of the European economy as well. While on the other side, China has maintained to stay as a strong force in the global economic system even during the challenging global economic situation. Right now, international political camps and the global economy is de-globalized and international governance is facing intense divisions while humanity is facing a choice to choose which economic system to be aligned with. China with its vibrant economic performance is pushing up the vision of globalization for building a shared future of mankind while other Western nations under the vision of Americanization are pushing up the theories of anti-globalization and isolationist approaches. Starting from the US to NATO, they all consider China as their strategic rival, so in this situation, China does not need to prove its economic strength, but the actions of Western nations is proof of China's economic brilliance. Following 45 years of reform and opening up, China has achieved such economic achievements that have attracted the attention of the international community. China's economy rose by 5.2 percent in 2023 that was far bigger than the other larger economies. China contributed one-third in global economic development. Business weekly Bloomberg have also predicted that China's economy will expand in the next 10 years and will become the single largest economy of the world while Financial Times have also highlighted that that China's economy will emerge as an important driving force of 21st century. It is not difficult to understand that China carries a large operational market and complete industrial system while China's economy is resilient with tremendous capacity. China's government has the strong capacity to control and regulate performing economy and also carry a capacity to control the systematic risks and to further stabilize the economy by following various policy measures. Now China's economy is shifting from the phase of fastest development towards high-quality development and its economic model is continuously changing and upgrading for better economic results. The new driving strength of development is on the rise with the new quality productive forces are in full swing. High-level opening up is expanding while the Chinese modernization is on the path of prosperity for the Chinese nation. While keeping in view China's economic performance, Western manipulated theories about the Chinese economic collapse are not more than a failed trap, while Western psychological warfare cannot in any way stop the continuous development of the Chinese economy. China enjoys the institutional advantages of a socialist market economic system while China's long-term economic development trend has never been changed. This all has enhanced the confidence and firm commitment of China that country's economic system will always be secured and strong against all headwinds.

The administration said in a news release that the Shijian 19 satellite touched down on the Dongfeng Landing Site at 10:39 am and was then opened by ground recovery personnel sent by the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center to take out mission payloads. There were plant seeds, microorganism samples, technology demonstration devices, space experimental instruments as well as cultural items placed inside the satellite. Moreover, the Shijian 19 carried science payloads from five nations, including Thailand and Pakistan, according to the administration. The spacecraft was placed into space by a Long March 2D carrier rocket that lifted off from the Jiuquan spaceport on Sept 27. Developed by the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing, Shijian 19 was tasked with servicing space-based mutation breeding programs and carrying out flight tests for the research of domestically developed materials and electronic components. According to the release, the satellite features a high level of microgravity inside its body and a large carrying capacity. It is a good platform for high-microgravity experiments and its service will facilitate studies in microgravity physics and life science. China launched its first recoverable satellite in 1975, becoming the third nation, after the United States and former Soviet Union, to have such spacecraft. The country has lifted nearly 30 such spacecraft since then. These satellites have enabled Chinese scientists to carry out hundreds of space-based tests and experiments.

The G20 Summit, hosted by Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Monday and Tuesday, took place amid shifting geopolitical dynamics and economic uncertainty, providing an opportunity for world leaders to get together to discuss solutions to address urgent global challenges, including economic stagnation, trade disruptions, food security, reform of multilateral institutions and climate governance. As leader of the second-largest economy and the largest developing country in the world, Xi's attendance and his interactions with other leaders at the summit were in the spotlight. Addressing the summit, he outlined China's eight actions to support global development, including pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, implementing the Global Development Initiative, supporting international cooperation on poverty reduction and food security, and supporting the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South. He called for improving global economic, financial, trade, digital and ecological governance to build a world economy characterized by cooperation, stability, openness, innovation and eco-friendliness. Evandro Menezes de Carvalho, a professor of international law at Fluminense Federal University in Brazil, said that taking a systemic view of global governance, Xi highlighted key actions in each of the main areas of global governance in his speech. ""China has already given concrete demonstrations of being a country committed to the development of a more inclusive international order. In addition, it has been very active in promoting green development with significant investment in technology and environmental protection,"" he said. The professor noted that global economic development depends on a balanced, stable financial and trade system that takes into account the needs of developing countries in order to promote a more inclusive international order, highlighting the importance of Xi's remarks on improving global digital and ecological governance with the Global South and developing countries involved. ""Global digital governance and ecological governance, which are increasingly linked to each other, if well directed towards the common good, could contribute to opening new paths for the future for humanity as they increasingly exert influence in today\'s world."" Under the Brazilian presidency, the Rio G20 Summit adopted the motto ""Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet"", focusing on three priority themes: energy transition, fair sustainable development (with an emphasis on combating hunger, poverty and inequality), and reform of multilateral institutions. China, standing at the forefront of the Global South, has been advocating for greater representation of developing countries in global governance to promote an international order that is truly democratic, inclusive and multilateral. From advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to proposing the construction of a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation, and building a community with a shared future for mankind, China's consistent goal has been to build a more equal and just world, ensuring that developing countries have a greater voice in global affairs, observers said. At the Rio G20 Summit, Xi urged the World Bank to carry out a shareholding review and the International Monetary Fund to carry out quota share realignment in line with the agreed time frame and road map in order to increase the voice and representation of developing countries. He said that China, alongside Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, is proposing an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science to help the Global South gain better access to global advances in science, technology and innovation. Anthony Moretti, an associate professor in the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in the United States, said that Xi is spot on when he suggests that isolationism is not what the global community needs right now. This is especially true for the developing world, Moretti added. Mehmood Ul Hassan Khan, executive director of the Center for South Asia and International Studies in Islamabad, Pakistan, said that Xi has made proposals for an open, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for international economic cooperation through a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. His proposals support developing countries in better integrating into digital, smart and green development to bridge the North-South gap, and they constitute a holistic and comprehensive policy badly needed for economic recovery, poverty reduction and job creation, Khan said, adding they reflect the global need for complete transformation from isolation to integration, from Cold War mentality to international cooperation. As the Ukraine crisis and Palestine-Israel conflict remain protracted, Xi highlighted at the Rio G20 Summit that ""global security governance is part and parcel of global governance"". The G20 should support the UN and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, he said. China and Brazil, together with some other Global South countries, have launched a group of ""friends for peace"" on the Ukraine crisis, with the goal of bringing together more voices for peace. Khan said that the proposal of the group of ""friends for peace"" is innovative and well-timed, which must be listened to and implemented for achieving peace in Ukraine and Palestine. Marcos Cordeiro Pires, a professor of international political economy at Sao Paulo State University, said that the China-proposed Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilization Initiative and Belt and Road Initiative are becoming international public goods that offer a path to building actions that help overcome the immense challenges faced by humanity. These initiatives are a counterpoint to selfishness and unilateralism by pointing out that development is essential to overcoming hunger and poverty, that no country can guarantee its security at the expense of others, that peaceful coexistence between civilizations presupposes respect for the uniqueness of each culture, and, above all, that building infrastructure is one of the best ways to guarantee progress and address inequalities, Pires said. The Chinese president also urged G20 countries to ""see each other\'s development as opportunities rather than challenges and view each other as partners rather than rivals"", highlighting the need to observe the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and defend the international order based on international law. Xu Feibiao, a senior researcher and the director of the Center for BRICS and G20 Studies of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that China, unlike traditional Western powers, remains committed to safeguarding a multilateral system with the UN at its core, following the path of peaceful development, and advocating for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. It calls for a new type of international relations and upholds the principles of ""extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits"" in global governance, Xu said, adding these efforts and principles are gaining broader recognition and respect from countries all over the world, offering hope for the G20 to regain its relevance in global governance. The Rio G20 Summit adopted a leaders' declaration, with the G20 leaders reaffirming their strong commitment to multilateralism and pledging to reform the global governance system. The leaders pledged to work for a reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system, rooted in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law, with renewed institutions and a reformed governance that is more representative and effective, according to the declaration. They also pledged to reform the UN Security Council to align it with the realities and demands of the 21st century and make it more representative, inclusive and effective, the declaration said.

25,China's political system truly serves the people,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\26\WS66cbbdeba31060630b924d70.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/26/WS66cbbdeba31060630b924d70.html,"This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of China's National People's Congress. The people's congress system is a key part of China's whole-process people's democracy, which differs in a number of respects with Western style democracy, especially in terms of its goals and decision-making. Whole-process people's democracy, as the term suggests, is focused on the people in that its main goal is to better serve the people, which finds manifestation in the role of the Communist Party of China. First, the core aim and main mission of the Party is to serve the people  hence, the people-centric development of whole-process people's democracy. For China's leadership, the interests of the people, all the people, not just a section of society, are paramount. Second, the social structure on which the Chinese sociopolitical system is based is egalitarian, not based on preferences for any class, creed, socioeconomic group, ethnicity or vested interests. And third, a key aspect of China's political system is that it is based on merit, where the best and the brightest talents are selected through a rigorous process of training and screening, and they gain experience by working from the grassroots upward, rising through the ranks by dint of their performance and professionalism. For example, the CPC or government officials have to prove their honesty, dedication to the cause of the people and leadership mettle to be promoted to the higher level, meaning they have to work with and for the people to climb up the Party's ranks. In contrast, the Western system works very differently despite the US claiming to be the greatest defender and promoter of democracy. In the US, decisions are often made by a cabal, a clique or a small group of influential, mostly rich people. Money is central to US-style democracy  for example, two-thirds of US senators happen to be millionaires. For example, when US President Joe Biden ""lost"" a debate against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on June 27, it was the rich donors of the Democratic Party who reportedly decided Biden should not contest the presidential election, and made sure Vice-President Kamala Harris replaced him as the Democratic presidential candidate. Once the donors decided to no longer fund the Biden campaign, his re-election bid was over. Meanwhile, Trump\'s campaign spending more than doubled last month as he significantly increased expenditures on advertisements targeting his new opponent Harris. Another important difference between the US system and Chinese system is that the former is now largely run by influential and powerful lobbies that operate out of Washington. There are more than 100,000 lobbyists working directly or indirectly in Washington, and with a total budget of over $9 billion, they influence US policymaking. For example, one of the most powerful foreign policy lobbyists is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, while one of the most influential domestic policy lobbyists is the gun lobby run by the National Rifle Association, which is vehemently opposed to gun control laws despite the fact that every day on average 12 children are either killed or injured in gun violence in US schools and streets. Another difference in the way democracy functions in China and the US is the manner of decision-making. In China, decisions are made through debates and consultations, and are based on a broad consensus. For instance, the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee discussed and debated thoroughly in December 1978 before deciding to do ""course correction"" and launch the epochal reform and opening-up policy. The decision was reached after a thorough democratic debate and detailed discussions in a transparent manner. In contrast, in the US, as US columnist Thomas Friedman wrote in his article of May 8, 2003, in The New York Times,""25 men who were working (in the private sector) in the vicinity of the White House, had they been exiled to an island, there would have been no Iraq War"". In other words, in the US, the decision to invade Iraq was made by a small secretive, unelected cabal of 25 influential men, which makes the invasion of Iraq unjust, illegal and immoral. Worse, the invasion of Iraq was not sanctioned by the United Nations, and was against international law. The core difference between US-style democracy and China's whole-process people's democracy is that the latter does not represent any vested interests nor is it a power game like in the US, where the military-industrial complex decides whom to wage war against irrespective of the costs and consequences to the US or the world. Thus, US-style democracy can be a threat to global peace, as it is dominated and dictated by the US military-industrial complex, while Chinese-style democracy ensures the country pursues a foreign policy based on peace, inclusivity and shared prosperity through connectivity and cooperation, without seeking conflict or confrontation which has, sadly, become a norm for the US system.

However, Sweden is not mentioned at all in the article.","**Tone and Style:**
The tone is neutral to critical, with a hint of skepticism towards the Western-style democracy. The author uses formal language and employs rhetorical devices such as metaphors (e.g., ""whole-process people's democracy"" being like a ""circle"" where decisions are made through consensus). Notable stylistic features include emotional language (""democracy can be a threat to global peace""), use of rhetorical questions (""25 men who were working...made the invasion of Iraq unjust, illegal and immoral?""), and emotive phrases (""the people-centric development of whole-process people's democracy"").

**Implied Motives:**
The implied motive is to promote an agenda against Western-style democracy. The author seems to be critical of the US system and its perceived dominance in global politics.

* The author frames the Chinese system as more equitable, merit-based, and peaceful compared to the US system.
* The comparison of the two systems highlights their differences and potential implications for global peace.
* The use of loaded terms (e.g., ""US-style democracy"") and emotive language (""democracy can be a threat to global peace"") suggests that the author is promoting an agenda.

**Subtle Implications:**
The article subtly implies biases against the US system, using phrases like ""dominated by the US military-industrial complex"" and ""makes the invasion of Iraq unjust, illegal and immoral?"" The author also uses rhetorical questions to highlight potential flaws in the Western-style democracy.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The intended effect is to instill skepticism towards the US system. The author seems to be trying to persuade readers to consider alternative perspectives on democracy.

* The language used is formal and objective, aiming to present a balanced view.
* However, the inclusion of specific examples (e.g., the 25 men who influenced the Iraq War) creates an impression that some details are being withheld or exaggerated.

**Summary:**
The article discusses the differences between China's whole-process people's democracy and Western-style democracy. The author argues that China's system prioritizes the needs of the people over those of powerful lobbies, promoting a merit-based decision-making process. This contrasts with the US system, which is dominated by influential groups and lacks transparency in decision-making processes.

26,China's rise as a dual Olympic host and global sports power,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\04\WS66ff9c94a310f1265a1c6209.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/04/WS66ff9c94a310f1265a1c6209.html,"BEIJING -- When reflecting on the remarkable growth of Chinese sports over recent decades, few events better represent this progress than the historic ascent of Mt. Qomolangma via the north slope by Chinese mountaineers in 1960. This achievement symbolizes a national spirit of overcoming obstacles and striving for new heights. The Paris 2024 Olympic Games serve as a modern testament to this enduring drive, with China achieving an unprecedented milestone by securing 91 medals, including 40 golds - marking its best performance at an overseas Summer Olympics. Over the past 75 years, China's sporting journey has been characterized by numerous breakthroughs. This journey reflects not only athletic achievements but also a deep commitment to competition and national pride. ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS In 1956, Chen Jingkai made history by setting a world record in weightlifting, becoming the first Chinese athlete to break a world record just seven years after the founding of the People's Republic of China. With minimal infrastructure but significant encouragement from the country, this achievement was remarkable. Three years later, Rong Guotuan won the men's singles title at the 25th World Table Tennis Championships, becoming China's first world champion. In 1958, China formally withdrew from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in protest of Taiwan's inclusion. However, in the 1970s, China's leaders began to recognize the benefits of greater international involvement and sought readmission to the IOC. China\'s return to the Summer Olympics came in 1984 in Los Angeles, after the IOC restored the Chinese Olympic Committee as a full member in 1979. At the Games, shooter Xu Haifeng earned China\'s first-ever Olympic gold, with the national anthem ""March of the Volunteers"" played in an Olympic stadium for the first time. ""During that era, our country needed a boost in our national pride,"" Xu later recalled. Another iconic moment came when the Chinese women's volleyball team claimed gold at the 1984 Olympics by defeating the United States. They went on to achieve an unprecedented run of five consecutive global titles between 1981 and 1986. Despite modest expectations before the 1984 Games, China finished an impressive fourth in the medal table, winning 15 golds. These performances inspired a generation of athletes and ignited a fervent interest in sports throughout the nation. Following these achievements, China significantly increased investment in sports infrastructure, talent development programs, and international sporting events, all aimed at establishing the country as a global sports power. A defining moment came in 2008, when Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics, and the host nation topped the medal tally with 48 golds out of 100 total medals. Although traditionally stronger in the Summer Games, China was a latecomer to winter sports. It wasn't until 2002 that the country claimed its first Winter Olympic gold, with Yang Yang winning the women's 500m short track speed skating final. By 2022, China had earned nine gold medals at its home Winter Olympics, following a significant investment in winter sports development. As China continues to rise as a sports power, its athletes' success on the global stage embodies the nation's dedication to excellence and its pursuit of greatness. Meanwhile, younger generations of athletes are more expressive than their predecessors, reflecting broader societal changes in China. Their self-confidence mirrors the growing assurance of Chinese society itself. ""While the medals signify China\'s \'hard power,\' the athletes\' poise, confidence and the unity displayed during the Games are a testament to China\'s burgeoning \'soft power\',"" read a commentary from Pakistan Today. SPORTS FOR ALL Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the government has prioritized sports as a means to promote a healthy lifestyle. To encourage public health, China introduced its first set of radio gymnastics in 1951, broadcast daily so people nationwide could follow along. In 1995, the State Council implemented ""The National Fitness Program,"" aimed at embedding sports and physical activities within society. As a result, the accessibility and quality of fitness facilities improved, and public enthusiasm for sports grew. To celebrate the success of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, August 8 was designated as ""National Fitness Day,"" encouraging widespread participation in sports. By 2014, fitness for all had been established as a national strategy, with increased resources directed toward this effort. Hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics fueled an ambitious goal to engage more than 300 million Chinese citizens in snow and ice sports. By the end of 2022, over 3,000 schools had integrated winter sports into their curriculum, including theory-based classes and practical sessions. In the colder northern regions, primary and middle schools incorporated winter sports into physical education, while areas with little or no snow promoted ""dry land"" practice of these sports. With these efforts, the number of people regularly participating in sports has risen to over 37% of the population. The growth of sports like road running and cycling has been especially rapid; a 2023 report on China's road running events indicated that 699 races were held nationwide, attracting over 6.05 million participants. ""In an era where sedentary lifestyles have contributed to health issues like obesity and diabetes, such increases in physical activity can only be positive,"" said Chang Chun, a professor at Peking University\'s Department of Social Medicine and Health Education. GLORY OF DUAL OLYMPIC HOSTS China's contributions to global sports extend beyond athletic achievements; the country has played a pivotal role in shaping modern international sporting events through successful hosting. In 1908, Chinese scholars, inspired by the modern Olympics, advocated for the country's participation. However, China faced political and social challenges, making it unprepared to compete internationally at that time. China's first Olympic participation came in 1932 in Los Angeles. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the country's focus on sports increased, and by the 1980s, China aimed to host the Olympics. Beijing's first bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful, losing to Sydney by two votes, but the determination persisted. China\'s perseverance was rewarded on July 13, 2001, when Beijing won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Games, often referred to as China\'s ""coming-out party,"" highlighted the nation\'s modernization and its potential as a global player. World-class facilities and meticulously organized events like the opening ceremony showcased China\'s capacity to host major international competitions. Beijing 2008 left lasting legacies for China, significantly impacting the development of sports in the country. These foundations were built upon during the preparations for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Beijing 2022 Games were held successfully, highlighting China's ability to organize large-scale international events in difficult circumstances. The event's diverse participation - featuring athletes from 91 countries and regions, including tropical nations without winter sports traditions - showcased the unifying power of sports. The 2022 Games set new benchmarks for the Olympic movement, emphasizing ""green Olympics"" through the use of carbon-neutral technologies, energy-efficient venues, and reforestation efforts. By hosting both the Summer and Winter Olympics, China has demonstrated its capability as a powerful participant and a visionary host in the global sporting community. As IOC President Thomas Bach noted, ""Having the world\'s most populated nation in the Olympic movement has proved a huge success story for China and the Olympic movement in recent years, and you can see the growing contribution of China to the Olympic movement.""

The signing of the agreements was witnessed by visiting Premier Li Qiang and Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Li arrived in Hanoi late Saturday afternoon to kick off a three-day visit to the Southeast Asian country. The visit came after Li concluded a visit to Laos, where he attended a series of leaders' meetings on East Asian cooperation and made an official visit. Noting that both China and Vietnam are developing countries at a crucial stage of modernization, Li told the Vietnamese prime minister that Beijing firmly supports Hanoi in pursuing a steady socialist path that suits its national conditions. He expressed willingness to work with Vietnam to jointly implement the cooperation plan for the synergy of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Vietnam\'s ""Two Corridors and One Economic Circle"" plan. China is ready to deepen cooperation with Vietnam in connectivity, trade and investment, tourism, healthcare, disaster prevention and reduction, and expand cooperation in local currency settlement, the digital economy and green development, Li said. Statistics show that China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and remains the largest export market for Vietnamese agricultural products. From January to July, bilateral trade volume reached $145.07 billion, an increase of 20.9 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The Vietnamese prime minister emphasized that developing relations with China is the top priority and strategic choice of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Vietnamese government. He called on the two countries to explore new models of collaboration, such as cross-border economic cooperation zones, and to intensify exchanges in education, tourism and youth. During the talks, the two leaders also reiterated their commitment to sticking to friendly consultation in properly handling differences, and to safeguarding maritime peace and stability and expanding maritime cooperation. On Saturday, upon his arrival, Li also met with To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and Vietnamese president. Li expressed hope that the two sides will simultaneously promote the ""hard connectivity"" of railway, expressway and port infrastructure and the ""soft connectivity"" of smart customs to provide solid support for improving the facilitation of trade and investment and safeguarding the stability and smooth flow of industrial and supply chains. The Vietnamese president said his country is willing to take the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries next year as an opportunity to maintain regular high-level exchanges, and to strengthen exchanges between parties, legislatures and civil societies. China and Vietnam have engaged in close high-level exchanges in recent years.

Sahib Shah, headmaster of the school, says 220 students from grades one to five are studying there, and after completing their education they will join the Pakistani government-run schools for higher classes.

Xi delivered his keynote speech, titled ""Building an Open, Inclusive and Interconnected World For Common Development"", at the opening ceremony of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on Wednesday. In the speech, he announced eight major steps that China will take to support the joint pursuit of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, including ""building a multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity network"". He also highlighted the concept of ""global modernization"", saying that China will work with all parties involved to deepen the Belt and Road partnership of cooperation and ""make relentless efforts to achieve modernization for all countries"". Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, when visiting the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing after the opening ceremony, quoted parts of Xi\'s speech, such as ""humankind is a community with a shared future"" and ""we should jointly address various global risks and challenges"". ""This is something all of those countries who subscribe to the policy of self-reliance and independence and wish to determine their own future independently are eager to hear,"" Vucic added. He recalled Xi\'s visit to Serbia in 2016, saying the visit ""helped with Serbia\'s development tremendously"". With China's help, a Serbian steel mill, which is a landmark BRI project, had become one of Serbia's top exporters. ""Some officials in the West see China as a rival and say they want to compete with and defeat China. This kind of thinking is still stuck in the old world order,"" he said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the Belt and Road Initiative provides a crucial and effective way to help developing countries achieve sustainable development, and sets a model for South-South cooperation. The eight major steps announced by Xi fully align with the purposes and principles of the UN and can help developing countries accelerate their development, Guterres told Xi during their meeting on Wednesday. Zhai Kun, a professor at Peking University\'s School of International Studies, said the eight major steps show that ""Beijing is determined to fully carry out the BRI blueprint and translate it into reality without interruption"". ""The detailed actions reflect an amazing evolution of themes for cooperation over the course of the past 10 years, from regular cross-border trade to social network-based e-shopping, and from basic digital infrastructure to artificial intelligence governance,"" Zhai said. Muhammad Zamir Assadi, a Pakistani political analyst and a journalist with the Islamabad-based Country Media Group, said Xi\'s speech ""has sent the message to the international community that it is a time of unity, it is a time of cooperation and it is a time of stepping forward together"". ""The speech has told the international community that the achievements of China are to be availed by all,"" Assadi said after attending the opening ceremony. ""People in different participating countries are looking for the peaceful development that should not be attached with any kind of political strings, and the BRI offers choices of development that are meeting the needs of the local people,"" he said. ""We should reject a bloc mentality, we should reject the voices of anti-globalization and unilateralism, and we should reject the mentality of egoism,"" he added. Leaders and observers said Xi's speech has provided the blueprint for the next decade of the high-quality development of the BRI framework and has highlighted the great achievements and contributions of the BRI in the first decade of its development. The concrete actions pledged in Xi's speech have underlined China's sincerity in bringing more opportunities for sustained, green economic growth to developing countries. Erik Solheim, former undersecretary-general of the UN and a keen observer promoting green development, noted that some local transportation facilities in Sri Lanka have embraced a major upgrade, attracting more foreign tourists, ""thanks to China providing some of the expertise, knowledge and financial input"". In his speech, Xi announced that the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China will each set up a 350 billion yuan ($48 billion) financing window, while an additional 80 billion yuan will be injected into the Silk Road Fund to support BRI projects. Solheim, who was present during Xi\'s speech, said it was ""very moving"" when the president said that China ""can only do well when the world is doing well"". ""That\'s exactly the right way of framing the relationship between nations,"" Solheim said. ""We are dependent on each other. There\'s no way we can solve any of the big problems in the 21st century unless we work together, as we want to avoid future pandemics, restart the economy after COVID, bring every single human out of poverty, (and) avoid climate change,"" he added. In a bilateral meeting with President Xi on Wednesday evening, Kenyan President William Ruto said the eight major steps proposed in Xi's speech can further help Kenya and Africa achieve industrialization, agricultural modernization and economic integration. Africanews Television commented, ""As for China-Africa cooperation, one of the BRI\'s most significant features is its emphasis on green infrastructure projects and renewable energy development."" Liu Ying, director of the cooperative research department at Renmin University of China\'s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, said that Xi gave a clear definition of the goals of global modernization in his speech, which is ""to enhance peaceful development and mutually beneficial cooperation and bring prosperity to all"". ""His speech has pointed the direction for global economic governance,"" Liu said. ""In today\'s world, the phenomenon of unbalanced and insufficient development is prominent, and anti-globalization thinking is surging,"" she added. China's commitment to greater opening-up and building an open world economy as reaffirmed by Xi's speech was also noted. Japan's Kyodo news agency highlighted key data outlined by the Chinese president  China's total trade in goods and services is expected to exceed $32 trillion and $5 trillion, respectively, from 2024 to 2028  and praised the nation's move of removing all restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector, which was also announced by Xi in his speech.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202310/20/6531cf6fa3109068cafe7aa3.jpeg'],['President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday.

In the company's drying facility, employees spread out pine cones, filling the air with a rich fragrance. After being dried, the pine cones will be processed into pine nuts and sold to countries and regions in Asia, Europe and North America. ""Since late August, our employees have been going to the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang to purchase pine cones,"" said Xie Yu, the company\'s general manager. ""The pine cone harvest is in autumn, and we plan to purchase 500 metric tons of red pine cones. Meanwhile, we have received a large amount of orders, ushering in a peak season for pine nuts,"" she added. Established in 2013, the company is engaged in deep processing and export of pine nuts, achieving an import and export volume of 67 million yuan ($9.25 million) in 2023. As the world's largest pine nut distribution center, each year, Meihekou gathers pine nut raw materials from around the world, where they are dried, processed and then sold to over 40 countries and regions worldwide. ""There are 303 pine nut processing enterprises in Meihekou, producing about 50,000 tons of nut products annually, accounting for around 80 percent of the national output,"" said Cui Lin, deputy secretary-general of the city\'s pine nut association. ""Among them, nearly 10,000 tons of finished nut products are exported, firmly holding over 60 percent of the global pine nut market share. It is estimated that around 80,000 tons of pine nut raw materials will be processed in Meihekou this year and then sold to various parts of the world,"" Cui said. As one of the oldest plants on Earth, pine trees have existed for about 300 million years and the history of pine nuts being consumed in China can be traced back over 2,000 years. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, when people in Meihekou learned about demand for pine nut products abroad, they immediately began to establish business channels. As the local soil was not suitable for pine trees, they started purchasing pine cones from the Changbai Mountain area, processing them by shelling and drying, and exporting them as pine nuts. In the late 1990s, the use of pine nut processing machinery greatly increased production efficiency and more pine nut processing enterprises appeared in Meihekou, gradually making it a base for pine nut processing and trade as well as a hub for pine nut commercial information. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of processing capabilities and the expansion of the trade market, pine nut procurement has expanded from Changbai Mountain to areas such as the Lesser Hinggan Mountains, the provinces of Yunnan, Shaanxi and Shanxi, as well as countries and regions including Russia, Mongolia, Pakistan and Kazakhstan. Furthermore, the people of Meihekou have gradually found a way to accumulate wealth nearby by planting pine trees in the mountains surrounding Meihekou, making seed picking more convenient and cost-effective. This autumn, Ding Yifeng, 32, has achieved a bountiful harvest in the red pine forests of Shuangxing township. ""It is my fourth year of contracting, and now the trees are around 40 to 50 years old. I\'m likely to see a harvest of around 50 tons of pine cones this year, which may bring me good economic benefits,"" Ding said. ""The city has introduced a series of preferential policies, such as returning farmland to forests, and I believe in the future, more pine nuts will be harvested by ourselves,"" he added. So far, Meihekou has cultivated and developed over 14,666 hectares of red pine forestland. ""In the future, we will focus on developing scientific and technological innovation of the products, increase the added value and extend the industrial chain,"" said Cui.

Cricket was one of five sports added to the LA Games by the International Olympic Committee on Monday. Flag football, baseball-softball, lacrosse and squash were also included. Organizers have proposed a six-team Twenty20 cricket competition  the shortest format of the game  for women and men in LA. ""After a wait of more than a century, our beloved sport is back on the Olympic stage,"" former India captain Sachin Tendulkar wrote on X, the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter. ""This marks the dawn of a new era for cricket as it will be a golden opportunity to foster inclusivity and showcase new talent from emerging cricketing nations. A start of something truly special!"" Monday's decision was made at an IOC meeting in Mumbai, the Indian city that will host five matches at the ongoing Cricket World Cup. ""Our beautiful game of cricket has a rich heritage and diverse international following,"" said Pakistan captain Babar Azam, the world\'s top-ranked one-day international batsman. ""It has the potential to enhance the spirit of Olympics even further. Cricket in the Olympics will inspire (a) new generation, athletes and fans around the globe."" Cricket was last played at the Olympics in 1900, but the game is played at other multisport events like the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. It is likely to be retained for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, which will be held in cricket-loving Australia. ""Players will get the chance to compete for an Olympic gold medal and be part of the Games, which will be so special,"" said Mithali Raj, a former India women\'s team captain. ""It\'s also a chance for more fans around the world to enjoy our fantastic sport."" For the last two years, the International Cricket Council has been working extensively with the IOC for inclusion at the LA Games. ""To have the opportunity to showcase our great sport at the LA28 Games and hopefully many Olympic Games to come will be great for players and fans alike,"" ICC chairman Greg Barclay said. The ICC hoped the Olympics, which have an estimated audience of more than 3 billion, will provide an opportunity for cricket to ""engage new audiences and further boost the sport\'s reach across the world, opening the door to a new generation of cricket enthusiasts."" Another Indian cricket great, Sunil Gavaskar, was also excited for the players to mingle with athletes from around the world. ""That is totally fantastic, isn\'t it?"" Gavaskar said while commentating during Australia\'s cricket match against Sri Lanka. ""What an experience it\'ll be for every team, and particularly the Indian team, to be able to see what the Olympic Village is like, to be able to spend time with other athletes, other champions."" In Australia, the governing body of the sport in the country praised the decision as a chance to expand further afield. ""This is a game-changer for our sport that is already among the fastest growing in the world,"" Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said. ""The Olympic Games will undoubtedly increase the global reach of cricket, inspiring a whole new generation to love and play the game."" Cricket at the Los Angeles Olympics will be a six-team event for both men and women and will be played in the Twenty20 format. Los Angeles organizing committee sports director Niccolo Campriani said the format will be ""appealing to the younger crowd"". ""We are thrilled to welcome the world\'s second-most popular sport with an estimated 2.5 billion fans worldwide,"" Campriani said. ""Some of you might be wondering why in LA? Well, the commitment to grow cricket in the US is real, and it\'s already happening with the launch of the very first Major League Cricket season earlier this year, which exceeded all expectations. And the (men\'s) T20 World Cup in 2024 coming to US and West Indies."" 'Powerful combination' ""It\'s a win-win situation,"" ICC chairman Barclay told reporters in Mumbai of cricket\'s inclusion in the LA 2028 program. ""We\'ve got a global sport, what I think is the fastest-growing global sport, but getting onto the biggest sporting stage in the world, the Olympics, is a massive shot in the arm for the game,"" the New Zealander added. Explaining the push for cricket\'s inclusion, Los Angeles 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman said: ""We think the opportunity to bring a sport that has 2.5 billion rabid fans to what we think is the greatest sport city in the world, it\'s a really powerful combination."" Jay Shah, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, welcomed ""a momentous occasion"" that ""aligns"" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing on Saturday that India would bid to stage the 2036 Olympics. ""Moreover, we anticipate that this decision will yield significant financial dividends and have a profound positive impact on our sport\'s ecosystem,"" Shah said, with the decision to include cricket at LA 2028 estimated to increase the value of India\'s broadcasting rights for the IOC by over $100 million. But IOC president Thomas Bach, speaking after Monday\'s IOC session, said any financial boost would be a ""consequence"". ""The first argument and the most important argument is we have seen the growing international importance of cricket and the Olympic Games want to incorporate the most popular sports worldwide,"" said Bach.

The triumph ended China's 10-year wait to top the podium at the Asian Volleyball Confederation tourney, and followed a morale-boosting victory over powerhouse Brazil in June.  ""We showed great team spirit throughout the AVC Cup, and this victory has massively boosted our confidence. We have achieved our goals and also identified areas to improve on. That will benefit us in future matches,"" Wu told China Sports Daily. ""If a team can\'t manage any good results at a tournament and it\'s always ranked at the bottom, how can it have confidence? In the future, we need to be more aggressive but also stable at the same time. Otherwise, we\'ll find it harder when we face the European teams at the coming world championship."" Team China topped the podium at the AVC Cup in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, on Sunday with a 3-0(25-20, 25-23, 25-22) victory over Japan in the final. Having also recorded wins over Chinese Taipei, Bahrain, Pakistan, Iran and South Korea, China completed the tournament with a perfect record. The last time China won the championship was in 2012 when it beat Iran in the final in Vietnam. Young Chinese ace Zhang Jingyin claimed the Most Valuable Player award and was also named one of the Best Outside Spikers, while his teammates Zhang Zhejia and Peng Shikun shared the Best Middle Blockers award. ""I\'m thrilled to be awarded the MVP, as this is my first championship since I started playing in the junior tournaments. The journey was not easy for me,"" said Zhang Jingyin, 22. ""I need to thank many people who helped me along the way, including my coach, teammates and all the team\'s support crews. I will try harder in the future, and I will hold onto my dreams. I will use my passion for volleyball to attract more people to the sport."" The championship also proved to be an invaluable workout for middle blocker Zhang Zhejia. The 26-year-old had not played since last year's National Games, so was relieved to produce such impressive displays. ""I hadn\'t played for a long time, so I was a little unsure about my condition. The team played as one and all of us were so united. That\'s how we reached the top podium,"" Zhang Zhejia told China Sports Daily. ""When we were down at the tournament, nobody chose to simply give up. We played each match point by point. And even in the match-point moments, we all handled the pressure well. We showed our skills. ""It was nice to get some recognition with the Best Middle Blockers award, and it also motivates me. We still have a lot of problems to fix, and we will try to improve in the coming matches."" Zhang Jingyin and Zhang Zhejia's progress was especially pleasing to see for coach Wu. ""It\'s normal for the young players to be nervous in big tournaments, but after some matches, they all fitted in well. They all have great potential,"" said Wu. ""Actually, both the young players and the veterans are gluing together well, as one united team. We all have the same goal."" Perhaps China's defining moment of the AVC Cup was the team's breathtaking turnaround in the semifinal against South Korea on Saturday, when Wu's men withstood match points in the fourth and fifth sets before eventually emerging victorious 3-2 (20-25, 25-17, 32-34,29-27, 17-15). ""If even one of our players had given up that day, we would have lost the match,"" said Wu. ""That match actually exposed many of our weaknessesparticularly serving and blocking. After the match, we conducted a thorough analysis session. ""I think some of the players didn\'t have the right mentality. They might have thought we\'ve played top teams like Brazil so beating Asian teams was going to be easy. Before the final, we just reminded them about their shortcomings in the semifinal and told them to give it their all in the final. That\'s how we produced a good performance."" Ranked 19th in the world, China surprised fans in June by defeating third-ranked Brazil in the FIVB Volleyball Nations League, with that momentum carrying through to the AVC Cup. Next up is the world championship in Poland and Slovenia from Aug 26 to Sept 11, with Team China currently in Serbia to prepare for the tournament. ""We showed great momentum and good skills at the AVC Cup, and we will have about 10 days to adjust in Serbia, after which we will go directly to Slovenia,"" said Wu.

However, this time, we are exploring a broader array of cities  some lesser-known yet equally captivating,"" said Gloria Tsang, a Gen Zer from the United States. Tsang took part in the ""Opportunities in China: Magnificent Guangxi  Guangxi in the Eyes of International Media 2024"" event, held from Oct 26 to 30, co-hosted by the Publicity Department of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and China Daily. This event gathered Gen Z delegates from seven countries  the US, Russia, Italy, Denmark, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Vietnam  alongside journalists and editors from six international media outlets. As Li Pan, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the CPC Guangxi Committee, introduced at the event's opening ceremony, these young global participants and media professionals would embark on an immersive journey to Guangxi's cities of Qinzhou, Beihai, and Fangchenggang. ""A dynamic representation of modernization with Chinese characteristics in Guangxi will be brought to life through your words and lenses, allowing friends both at home and abroad to appreciate a China that is credible, appealing, and respectable,"" he said. Wang Hao, China Daily's deputy editor-in-chief, underscored the pivotal role young people play in global communication. ""Dear young friends, we aspire for you to serve as ambassadors of Guangxi\'s stories, contributors to the revitalization of the Asia-Pacific region, and pioneers of human advancement,"" he said at the opening ceremony. Tsang was impressed by Guangxi's unique cultural heritage. At the Maritime Silk Road Intangible Cultural Heritage Experience Hall in Hepu, Beihai, she was captivated by a traditional horn carving masterpiece titled Ode to Spring, marveling at its intricate depiction of a shrimp within waves, symbolizing nature's anticipation of warmer days. ""As a coastal area, Guangxi\'s traditional art often revolves around sea animals and maritime themes. It\'s unique,"" she said. ""The way they\'ve polished that horn  it\'s almost like glass. How amazing."" The ocean not only enriches Guangxi with abundant tourism resources but also contributes to its economic growth. The region is strategically establishing industrial parks near its borders and ports while developing a robust transportation network that connects waterways, ports, railways, and air travel. The Beibu Gulf International Cruise Homeport in Beihai is a prime example of this vision in action. It has gradually launched domestic and international cruise routes, including one from Beihai to Halong Bay in Vietnam. Tran Phuong Linh, a college student from Vietnam, expressed excitement about the cruise route. ""Halong Bay is a famous tourist attraction in Vietnam, and now it can be conveniently reached from Guangxi,"" she said. ""Tourism activities can also promote trade between the two countries. I hope this port can become a cornerstone for more economic exchanges between China and Vietnam in the future."" In fact, Guangxi's external exchanges date back thousands of years. As early as the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), Hepu served as the starting port for the Maritime Silk Road. At the Hepu Maritime Silk Road Cultural Relics Exhibition in the Hepu Han Dynasty Culture Museum, Raja Saadatullah Khan from Pakistan recognized his homeland on an ancient map. He hadn't expected that Pakistan had established contact and trade with China so long ago, with it all beginning right beneath his feet. Guangxi's growing international presence also left a strong impression on Zhao Jingnan, deputy chief editor of Sing Sian Daily Newspaper in Thailand. Zhao was surprised by a local tour guide\'s fluency in multiple languages, including Chinese, Cantonese, English, and Vietnamese. ""This ensures a seamless experience for international visitors, highlighting Guangxi\'s role as an emerging global hub that welcomes people from all over the world, fostering cultural exchange and international cooperation,"" she said. While advancing in modernization and development, Guangxi has also placed great emphasis on environmental protection. When visiting the Qingnian Water Control Project on the Pinglu Canal in Qinzhou, Rajendra Prasad Rimal, a journalist from Nepal's Jana Aastha News, was deeply moved by Guangxi's efforts to carry out such a major construction project while preserving the local ecosystem. The project includes animal passageways and fish ladders, ensuring the safe migration of local wildlife. Romantsova Kseniia, a young woman from Russia, chose the Beihai Golden Gulf Mangrove Ecological Tourism Area as her favorite place in Guangxi. Covering over 3,000 acres (1,214.57 hectares), this area is home to an extensive mangrove ecosystem, known for its resilience against strong winds and waves, earning it the titles of ""sea forest"" and ""coastal guardians"". Learning that these rare plants are now under national key protection, Kseniia felt reassured and delighted. ""I believe that environmental protection is the most important issue of this era. The whole world should find ways to address it. Guangxi is doing a great job,"" she said. From the ecosystem to its infrastructure and cultural heritage, visitors from around the world are gaining a multifaceted perspective on Guangxi's evolving story in modern times.

Fu delivered the joint statement on behalf of a cross-regional group of 28 member states, including the State of Palestine, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Cuba, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Sudan, Sri Lanka and others. ""Despite the global call to urgently lift unilateral coercive measures, the imposition of these illegal measures continues to cause devastating, sometimes even life-threatening consequences, to targeted countries and their peoples,"" Fu said. Unilateral coercive measures, coupled with secondary sanctions and over-compliance, ""exacerbate existing humanitarian and economic challenges, gravely affect the stability of the global production and supply chains, as well as food, energy and financial security, and seriously undermine the world economic order and the efforts of the countries concerned to achieve sustainable development goals,"" he added. In September, Alena Douhan, the UN special rapporteur on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures, submitted her report to the 57th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. In her report, Douhan said that unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries on China violate international law, negatively affecting the human rights of the Chinese people and causing spillover effects. The report also says unilateral coercive measures have led to a serious shortage of medicines, vaccines and medical equipment in the countries targeted, and that it has led to a rise in mortality rates, leaving those in vulnerable situations such as women, children, the elderly and the disabled in a particularly difficult situation. ""We recognize the work done by the special rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights for the United Nations Human Rights Council and take note of the reports, country visits and statements delivered by the special rapporteur,"" Fu said. ""We are also concerned that unilateral coercive measures and over-compliance have limited the ability of affected countries to access and acquire foreign investment and technologies, and hindered international cooperation in culture, arts, sports, travel, people-to-people exchanges and transport, including civil aviation,"" said Fu. In recent years, the United States has implemented a range of unilateral measures against China, including restrictions on semiconductor exports, limitations on key technologies and sanctions on certain Chinese companies. On Thursday, the United States imposed sanctions on two Chinese companies that it accused of ""directly assisting"" Russia in developing long-range attack drones used in the Ukraine war. China\'s Foreign Ministry said it firmly opposes the US imposing illegal unilateral sanctions against Chinese companies and does not accept ""groundless"" accusations and pressure from the US.

The poll scenario in India is a bit difficult to comprehend for people used to viewing elections based on the procedure followed by the US presidential election, or the general election in the United Kingdom or most other Western countries. The reason is the mind-boggling diversity in India in terms of languages, regional differences and local issues, and scores of regional political parties that contest the elections. Yet the focus is on Uttar Pradesh because it sends 80 of the 543 members, or almost 15 percent of the total members, to the Lower House and used to be the traditional power base of the Indian National Congress (or simply the Congress), the oldest political party in India which has given India nine prime ministers including the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi, with two of them being elected twice. But the ruling NDA, which Modi represents, won 64 of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh and 39 of the 40 in Bihar in the 2019 elections. This time, though, the opposition parties have aligned under the common umbrella of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) to bolster their combined strength, especially in the four critical states. The other provinces in which the BJP outperformed its opponents in the 2019 general elections include Delhi, Haryana and Jharkhand in northern India, Maharashtra and Gujarat in western India, and Karnataka in southern India. The BJP won all the seven parliamentary seats in Delhi in 2019. But, this time, to give a tough fight to the BJP in Delhi, the Congress has stitched an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (Common Man's Party), the ruling party in Delhi province. In South India, the Congress wrested power from the BJP in Karnataka province in the 2023 assembly election, strengthening its clout in the province which is home to the Indian ""Silicon Valley"" of Bangalore. Thus the poll battle in Karnataka, where the BJP was in power and had won 25 of the 29 Lower House seats in 2019, promises to be fierce this time. The BJP, despite being in power at the center, has little presence in the other southern Indian provinces: Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. While the Left parties and the Congress hold sway in Kerala, regional parties largely rooted in the anti-Brahmin movement, dominate the politics in Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have largely kept the BJP at bay perhaps because people there perceive it to be a party of north and central India. In the eastern Indian province of West Bengal, the BJP had sprung a big surprise in the last elections by winning 18 of the 42 Lower House seats, with the provincial ruling party, the All India Trinamul Congress, bagging 22 seats. Hence, the poll battle in West Bengal should be intense this time. The Modi-led BJP came to power in 2014 by promising to end corruption, check price rise, create millions of jobs, fight terrorism and, most of all, to boost economic growth. It retained power in 2019 by promising to maintain the growth momentum (which critics say never existed) and claiming it had taught Pakistan a ""valuable lesson"" for the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 40 security personnel were killed in February 2019. India alleges Pakistan orchestrated the Pulwama attack. However, the BJP this time faces public criticism for being corrupt after India\'s Supreme Court ruled that the electoral bond program, which the Modi government introduced in 2017 and benefited the most from, was ""illegal"" and ""unconstitutional"". The program allowed donors to political parties to buy bonds from any State Bank of India (India\'s biggest bank) branch which could be converted by the targeted political party into cash, and was designed to keep the names of donors and the amount they donated secret. But some civil society members and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) petitioned the Supreme Court, alleging that the donors, mostly big business houses, had been donating huge amounts to the ruling party to ""extract profit"" (or get favors) in lieu of the donations. Having heard the arguments of both sides, the Supreme Court ruled the bond program illegal, fueling a raging debate in India on the issue of corruption. Making aggressive Hinduism, which glorifies the past, its main poll plank, the BJP is seeking votes for building a temple to the Hindu deity Rama at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh and for ""handing out 5 kilograms of free food grains to 800 million families"" and periodically transferring small amounts of money to their bank accounts. On the other hand, the opposition INDIA bloc's parties say that in the 10 years of the Modi government, unemployment has increased drastically, inflation has spiraled out of control, farmers have become poorer instead of earning twice as much as they used to, as Modi had promised, wealth/income disparity has worsened and many minority community members, especially Muslims, have been attacked, killed and humiliated. To change all this, the opposition is asking the people to vote for the INDIA bloc parties. Only the June 4 results can tell us which party or coalition of parties has the ears of the people.

The latest trade fair further highlighted China's strong commitment to opening-up, modernization and global cooperation. The expo represented a gateway for translating China's vast market into great opportunities for the world, in line with President Xi Jinping's vision of shared global prosperity, trans-regional connectivity, and greater opening-up and cooperation. Foreign leaders and heads of international organizations have termed the CIIE an important international platform for promoting trade and investment. This highlights their confidence in the Chinese economy and its prospects, as well as the willingness to advance partnerships with China in multiple spheres, including the economy, investment, trade, connectivity and green development. Critical analysis and comparative studies show that the CIIE has become an effective platform in promoting the accessibility of international trade for all and in connecting the hubs of global development, security and civilizational initiatives. Over its first six editions, the CIIE facilitated deals worth a combined $420 billion, helping over 1,130 foreign enterprises and investment promotion organizations to forge connections across China. This showed the country's inbuilt economic innovation, expansion of consumer market and products, and attraction as an investment and business destination, not to mention its major role in the world economy. Remarkably, the participation of a record-breaking 297 Fortune Global 500 companies and industry leaders at the seventh CIIE, with 186 companies and organizations joining for the seventh consecutive year, reflects China's economic prowess, supply chain strength, high-quality industrialization and, above all, its firm belief in openness and modernization. Moreover, the participation of 39 government procurement delegations and four industry procurement delegations, a total of 780 trade subgroups, marked a historic high at the seventh CIIE, reaffirming China's role in the global economy, commerce, business, manufacturing, green technologies, hybrid agriculture and government-to-government, business-to-business and people-to-people connectivity. The CIIE has become the ultimate showcase of international trade groups gathering at the world's first import-themed national-level expo, fostering global economic collaboration and tapping the potential of the Chinese market for opportunities. It has also become an ideal hub for trans-regional integration of markets, ideas and innovations, successfully translating exhibited items into commercial opportunities and deals. It has become a gateway to China's vast market for international investors and businessmen, unleashing the dividends of openness and sharing China's new development opportunities with the rest of the world. China's inclusiveness, openness and vision of shared prosperity has seen exhibitors from 37 least developed countries getting free exhibition booths at the latest CIIE, helping expand the African products zone. Making the CIIE more interactive, productive and informative, events themed around ""sustainable development driven by new quality productive forces"" were held for the first time. Augmented reality experiences, artificial intelligence-powered robots, an astronomical satellite model and other cutting-edge technologies were on display to explore pathways to green and sustainable development. The CIIE epitomizes China's inclusive and innovative opening-up, with the nation's numerous policies helping spur international trade and investments. It has multiple socioeconomic effects in terms of promoting international procurement, attracting foreign investment inflows, boosting exchanges of commercial ideas and people-to-people exchanges, and supporting China's wider opening-up to international goods. China's safeguarding of the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core further supports developing countries in sharing more benefits of globalization. The country's readiness to continue close coordination and cooperation with all stakeholders in international economic organizations and its efforts to promote the implementation of the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement and advancement of the cause of an open world economy will help build bridges of mutual trust and boost economic cooperation, cross-border investments, joint ventures and globalization. That stands in contrast to the protectionism and the sanctions/tariffs gameplay of the United States, moves that could gain more traction now following the US presidential election early this month. The world has a chance for hope, betterment, welfare, stability and further integration because of the Chinese economy's resilience, diversification, innovation, openness and modernization, as it promotes steady economic growth and contributes to global development and the welfare of humanity.

42,FTZs help foreign firms thrive,"('Pakistan', 'Pakistani')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202406\24\WS6678485fa31095c51c50a568.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/24/WS6678485fa31095c51c50a568.html,"In 2018, Zeeshan Qasim Khan, a Pakistani student who had just graduated from Hainan Medical University, was planning to start an international trade venture in Guangdong province, China's leading economic powerhouse. Khan's initial plans, which focused on importing Pakistani rice, carpets and handicrafts to China, and exporting Chinese electronics, medical equipment and marbles to global markets, changed course following a pivotal announcement by President Xi Jinping. During the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of Hainan province and the Hainan Special Economic Zone in April 2018, Xi unveiled ambitious plans to transform the entire island into a pilot free trade zone and eventually establish a free trade port with unique Chinese characteristics. This announcement convinced Khan that he should remain in Hainan and capitalize on the emerging opportunities. Six years later, the decision was fully vindicated, Khan said, highlighting the preferential corporate and individual income tax policies as primary advantages of the Hainan Free Trade Port. ""The tax benefits are substantial, and we get more benefits in our businesses,"" Khan noted, referring to the 15 percent corporate income tax rate for enterprises in encouraged industries within the FTP, which is significantly lower than the usual 20 percent to 25 percent. Khan's company, located in the Haikou Fullsing Internet Industrial Park, is among the numerous foreign businesses that have benefited from China's growing openness to the global market and from sound supply and industrial chains, as the nation develops a network of free trade zones. In September 2013, China launched its first FTZ in Shanghai, marking a significant milestone in the country's reform and opening-up. The Shanghai FTZ introduced the first negative list for foreign investment, which was a radical departure from the previous method of listing sectors where foreign investment was encouraged. A negative list indicates the areas in which investment is prohibited or restricted; all other areas are presumed to be open. President Xi, who has been at the helm of these reforms, emphasized the importance of FTZs in driving the nation's economic agenda. ""On this new journey, we must build higher-level free trade zones based on a comprehensive summary of the past decade\'s experience,"" he said in an instruction in September, urging continued innovation and exploration in broader and deeper areas. During the annual session of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, in 2014, Xi stressed the need for FTZs to align with international investment and trade rules, enhance the institutional system and regulatory model, and balance market-driven resource allocation with effective government intervention. He called for boldness and innovation, aiming to develop replicable and scalable new systems to facilitate investment and trade, ensure efficient regulation and establish a standardized legal environment. China has so far established 22 FTZs, which contributed to about 18.4 percent of the nation's total import and export volume in 2023. The Hainan Free Trade Port has introduced over 120 innovative policies to date. Some analysts underlined Xi's vision for the FTZs, which served as a springboard for bold experimentation and systemic reform. Gu Xueming, president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, wrote in a co-authored report in November, ""The achievements of the past decade in the pilot FTZs prove that these zones have become pioneering forces of high-level openness, trailblazers of deep-seated reforms, models of high-quality development, and important platforms for serving national strategies."" He explained that the FTZs in China have come up with pioneering initiatives making them bold leaders in the country's reform and opening-up, including the implementation of negative lists for market entry and cross-border trade in services. The FTZs were also home to China's first wholly foreign-owned public fund management company and its first wholly foreign-owned automobile manufacturing enterprise. In the realm of deepening reforms, China's FTZs have consistently embraced bold experimentation and innovation, achieving significant breakthroughs in trade, investment, finance and government functions, he said. In Shandong province, the establishment of an FTZ has significantly spurred the inflow of foreign investment and boosted efforts to improve the business environment. Cui Linxian, an executive with SITC International Holdings Co, a Hong Kong-based shipping logistics company, highlighted the alignment of the zone's innovative spirit with the company's entrepreneurial ethos. The robust port infrastructure in Qingdao, the second-largest foreign trade port in China, provides an ideal environment for business growth, he said. He added that the Shandong FTZ aims to establish a world-class business environment, which has underpinned the company's efforts to enhance its core competitive edge. ""The authorities in the FTZ have continually simplified procedures and improved efficiency, adhering to a proactive service approach that shortens the path for enterprises to conduct their business,"" Cui said. ""By focusing on the needs of businesses as both the starting point and ultimate goal, multiple departments have collaborated to promote the integration of services into a unified one-stop."" Khan, the Pakistani national, also praised the introduction of favorable policies and one-stop services designed to attract and support foreigners living and working in Hainan, particularly those eager to engage in business activities despite language barriers. ""These measures simplify crucial processes such as work permits, visas and residency requirements, enhancing overall convenience and efficiency,"" he added. Khan said he believes that, as one of the world's largest free trade ports, the Hainan FTP will attract more young talent to the island province, promoting local economic and trade development. He has shared information about the preferential policies and vast opportunities in the Hainan FTP with friends in Pakistan and other countries, many of whom are considering relocating to Hainan to work and invest. Wang Ying, a researcher at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics' Academy of China Open Economy Studies, underscored the importance of the FTZ strategy in China's high-level opening-up agenda going forward. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said in his report to the 20th National Congress of the CPC in October 2022 that the nation will work faster to develop the Hainan Free Trade Port, upgrade pilot FTZs, and expand the globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas. Wang said the nation\'s FTZs will take on an even greater historical mission by coordinating deep reforms and high-level openness. ""The focus of FTZs should be on exploring deeper and broader reforms in key areas such as trade, investment, finance and cross-border data flows,"" she said. By expanding the scope and depth of pioneering reforms, the FTZs will enrich the application of free trade policies and amplify their benefits, Wang added. By advancing institutional openness through rules, regulations, management and standards, FTZs will serve as comprehensive experimental platforms for reform and opening-up, which will support China's accession to high-standard international trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, she added.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/24/66792239a31095c551b3f6a3.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/24/66792239a31095c551b3f6a5.png']","['Ships get ready for their voyages in the foreign trade container terminal of Qingdao port in Shandong province.

- **Mentions of Sweden:** Sweden is not mentioned significantly in the article. However, China's government announcement to transform its entire island into a pilot free trade zone and establish a free trade port with unique characteristics may be related to China's economic policies or reforms.","Tone: The overall tone of the article is neutral to optimistic, with a hint of admiration towards President Xi Jinping's vision for the Hainan Free Trade Port. The language used is formal, but not overly technical or complex.

Stylistic features:

* Emotional language is used sparingly to convey Khan's excitement and enthusiasm about his business opportunities in Hainan.
* Formal tone is maintained throughout, with no apparent attempt to engage in rhetorical devices such as metaphors or allusions.
* Loaded terms like ""pilot free trade zone"" and ""high-level openness"" are used to emphasize the significance of the project.

Subtle implications:

* The article implies that Khan's business success in Hainan is a result of President Xi Jinping's vision, suggesting that the government's policies may have played a crucial role in his decision.
* The use of phrases like ""simplified procedures and improved efficiency"" and ""unified one-stop services"" suggests that the introduction of favorable policies has streamlined the business process for foreign investors.
* The emphasis on ""pioneering initiatives"" and ""trailblazers of high-quality development"" may imply that Khan's company is among the first to adopt innovative approaches in Hainan.

Intended audience impact: The article aims to instill confidence and optimism about China's economic reforms, particularly its approach to free trade zones. By showcasing the benefits of investing in Hainan, Khan and others are likely to be persuaded to consider relocating or expanding their businesses in the province.

The use of expert quotes from Wang Ying, a researcher at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics' Academy of China Open Economy Studies, may also aim to provide credibility and authority on the topic. Overall, the article presents a positive view of China's economic reforms, highlighting the potential benefits for foreign investors."

Co-sponsored by the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation and Xinjiang's government departments, the exhibition features 312 rare photographs and six artifacts, highlighting the enduring friendship between Chinese and American people. ""We have scheduled the tour in 14 cities and Urumqi is our fourth stop,"" said Jeffrey Greene, chairman of the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation. He expressed hope that the exhibition tour would help more people know about the history of the close cooperation between China and the United States in the fight against Japanese invaders during World War II. The Flying Tigers, officially known as the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, was formed in 1941 by US General Claire Lee Chennault. They came to China to help Chinese people fight the invading Japanese troops. While the Flying Tigers did not directly engage in enemy forces in Xinjiang, they share a lesser-known connection to the autonomous region. Greene recounted attempts to establish alternative flight routes over the Himalayas, known as the Hump route, to circumvent Japan's blockade of strategic materials in 1942. ""Meng Chin, one of my friends, managed to fly over the towering Kunlun and Tianshan mountain ranges, reaching an airstrip near Urumqi from Karachi in Pakistan,"" he said. On his first visit to Xinjiang, Greene expressed his excitement at seeing the majestic Tianshan Mountains, sampling local cuisine, and experiencing the warm hospitality of people from various ethnic groups in the autonomous region. Clifford Long Jr., vice chairman of the foundation as well as the son of a Flying Tigers pilot, said that it's always emotional to talk about that history. ""My father was in China for just a short period, but it's one of the most memorable times of his life,"" he added. He said he had brought his father to China in 1994 and 2004, and that his father was thrilled by the remarkable progress made by the Chinese people. On Sunday, the foundation established partnerships with seven schools across Xinjiang. ""We hope through activities online and offline, we can enhance mutual understanding and friendship between young people in the two countries,"" Greene said. The foundation initiated the Flying Tigers Friendship School and Young Leaders Program in 2022 to promote the spirit of the Flying Tigers among Chinese and American students and deepen mutual respect and cooperation. To date, the program has partnered with nearly 60 schools across China. Noting that the relationship between the United States and China is the ""most important relationship on the planet"" and a ""guidepost and touchstone to the future,"" Greene said, ""There's nothing Americans and the Chinese can't do together and that's what we're teaching our kids.""","['http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d5ec4a310f1268d85e899.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d5ec4a310f1268d85e89f.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d5ec4a310f1268d85e8a5.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d5ec4a310f1268d85e8ab.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d5ec4a310f1268d85e8b0.jpeg', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d5ec4a310f1268d85e8b6.jpeg']","[""The opening ceremony of a photo exhibition dedicated to the Flying Tigers is held in Urumqi, capital of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Nov 30, 2024.

Organized by Peking University, Beijing Municipal Education Commission, and the Chey Institute for Advanced Studies, the event, in which leaders and scholars from around the world gathered in person and online, under the theme ""The Harmony of Civilizations and Prosperity for All: The Era of Innovation and Advancement of Mankind."" Speaking of the new challenges to international order and the development of human civilization posed by rapid advancements in technology such as AI, Gong Qihuang, President of Peking University, said that universities, serving as hubs for talent cultivation, scientific innovation, as well as a key point of civilization inheritance, should shoulder greater responsibilities to deepen exchanges and strengthen cooperation and confront the challenges of the times with innovation. ""The world is increasingly interconnected, and our collective future depends on harnessing the power of innovation to drive human progress. Today 50 percent of global GDP growth comes from innovation; but growth must be inclusive and equitable - even today 1 in 6 humans lacks access to electricity,"" said Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former prime minister of Pakistan. ""We must ensure that innovation serves humanity\'s greater good. We must promote cross-cultural understanding and celebrate diversity. And we must create social equity by addressing income disparities and promoting access to opportunities,"" said Abbasi. The EU must actively engage in peaceful cooperation, especially considering the currently inadequate level of collaboration. Peaceful cooperation should extend beyond politics to encompass technology and economics as well. In this context, technological collaboration among universities can play a pivotal role despite the current limitations, said Romano Prodi, former Prime Minister of Italy. In this era of innovation, no single country or organization can address global challenges alone, said Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK Group, in a video message sent to the forum. Chey believes that collaboration among businesses, governments, academia and civil society is essential to tackling complex societal issues.

45,"Forum fosters ties between China, Africa","('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\22\WS673febf1a310f1265a1cf0b4.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/22/WS673febf1a310f1265a1cf0b4.html," The China-Africa relationship is poised to grow to new heights under the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation framework, affecting not only the two parties but also the global arena, experts say. They also describe the framework as key in realizing the modernization of both China and Africa, which is expected to reshape the world. Wang Wen, dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said FOCAC is ""a great platform"" that strengthens existing cooperation while fostering future growth and shared aspirations. Speaking at a recent webinar, Wang said that over the past 24 years since its establishment, FOCAC has seen spillover effects of China's development model. During this period, Chinese enterprises have constructed and renovated more than 10,000 kilometers of railways in Africa, as well as nearly 100,000 km of highways and almost 1,000 bridges, he said. This is in addition to 1,000 ports, 66,000 km of power transmission lines, and 150,000 km of communication networks in various African countries. The framework has also seen China establish multiple agricultural technology demonstration centers in Africa, promoted more than 300 advanced and applicable agricultural technologies and achieved an increased amount of agriculture products imported from Africa for seven consecutive years, Wang said. With a huge market of nearly 3 billion people, China and Africa have inexhaustible potential in infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing, internet, transportation, tourism, among others, Wang added. Going forward, he pointed out that China-Africa cooperation will face some challenges, such as interference from the West, but urged both parties to have confidence and remain focused on their agenda. Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Pakistan-China Institute and president of the Pakistan-Africa Institute for Development and Research, applauded China's consistent assistance to many developing countries over the past decades. Soon after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, it was one of the first countries to lend a helping hand to its third-world brothers in Asia, including Pakistan, Hussain said. In Africa, China built the Tazara Railway in the 1970s, linking Tanzania with Zambia, and supported liberation movements in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia, he said. It was also at the forefront of the freedom struggle, as well as the struggle against racism, racial discrimination and Western hegemony in Africa. China's relationship with Africa is not transactional, temporary, or based on conditionality; it is based on peaceful development, win-win cooperation and inclusivity through the Belt and Road Initiative, Hussain said. On the contrary, the United States and other Western powers still view Africa in a Cold War context, where they try to intervene ostensibly on counterterrorism, but are promoting their own interests, he added. ""Chinese modernization is an example of the peaceful development of socialist modernization of harmony between nature and humanity, as opposed to the militarization promoted by the West, where they talk of control coercion, use of force and extraction,"" he said. Assessing threats Charles Onunaiju, director of the Center for China Studies in Abuja, Nigeria, said it is time for Africa and China to reflect on issues relating to strategic resilience and on how to maintain cooperation, as well as objectively assess strategic vulnerabilities and threats of the evolving China-Africa cooperation. ""This means reflecting on the wonderful trends that have occurred between China and Africa in the past 24 years and the outcome of the recent FOCAC summit (in Beijing),"" Onunaiju said. He highlighted the need to further develop capacity, which is key for sustainability, through interrogating the nature of the state, the social system and the processes in which the two partners have embarked on. ""We should see China-Africa cooperation as an important contribution for us to (address) the challenges Africa (faces) in terms of strategic resilience and our obvious weaknesses and strategic vulnerabilities,"" he said. Mahdi Gulaid, a member of Somalia's Parliament and former deputy prime minister of Somalia, said that with aligned goals, mutual respect and a shared vision, China and Africa stand as a powerful example of what global partnership can accomplish. The China-Africa partnership is not just economic, but also deeply rooted in mutual respect and the pursuit of common goals, Gulaid said, adding that FOCAC has brought infrastructure development, healthcare and digital progress across the continent. The three initiatives of Global Security, Global Civilization and Global Development proposed by China align closely with Africa's development agenda, he said. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/22/673febf1a310f1268d856fda.jpeg'],"['FILE PHOTO: Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu speaks at the opening ceremony of the ninth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, September 5, 2024.

47,Gaza reshaping life and imagination beyond Palestine,"('Pakistani',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202405\08\WS663aba98a31082fc043c5c84.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202405/08/WS663aba98a31082fc043c5c84.html,"""I live out by O\'Hare. Every time a plane flies overhead at night, my hands shake. I\'m looking for a place to hide. And then the sirens, the police and ambulance sirens. I know they\'re not there, but it feels like soldiers are just outside the window. We used to watch them walk up and down the road by my grandparents\' house, and we weren\'t to say anything. They\'d harass everyone, beat people up, including my grandpa. We were supposed to stay inside. My cousin was killed."" This is what a patient told me last November in Chicago, home to the largest number of Palestinian people in the United States. ""I haven\'t felt like this, had nightmares like this, since I was a kid,"" he added. Global South in Solidarity Since the Israeli bombing and other military operations in Gaza began following the Hamas attacks on Oct 7, a global movement has emerged, particularly from the Global South, in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Tens of millions of people have marched through the streets of cities across the world, protesting against Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip. In the US, the ruling class and closely linked media have typically portrayed such expressions of solidarity, if acknowledged at all, as simply a matter of vague ideological kinship or abstract anti-US or anti-Israel sentiment, often taking recourse to misleading accusations of anti-Semitism to explain it all away. But by doing so, they ignore its historical roots and the ongoing truth to which this movement testifies: There is a deep psychic and visceral connection that binds countless people from diverse backgrounds to the gruesome oppression of Palestinians and to the enabling indifference to it shown by so many North American and European observers. ""I\'m trying not to watch it, to look at the videos and the pictures of little kids trying to wake up their dead siblings, but it\'s impossible to avoid  and I don\'t want to avoid it. It\'s the truth. It\'s their truth, but it\'s also mine and my family\'s. But I just can\'t deal with it,"" another patient said. Yet another said: ""You leave, thinking it\'ll be better. But it doesn\'t stop. It just changes. Now you get to watch and pay for it rather than be stuck underneath it. I don\'t know which feels worse."" Shared experiences of intergenerational ordeal When viewed through the psychiatric and psychoanalytic clinic, it's clear that, for many, behind their solidarity with the Palestinian people today lies shared experiences of intergenerational suffering stemming from the legacy of ongoing US and European imperialism overseas and racism within. With social media allowing for an unprecedented level of worldwide proximity to an unfolding genocide after more than four centuries of colonial violence has generated a compounding reservoir of trauma passed from generation to generation on every continent, the images and cries of devastation in Gaza evoke much more than sympathy. They are triggering a profound sense of personal resonance. Many Pakistani, Iraqi, Afghan, Yemeni, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Irish, Haitian, Somali, Rwandan, Black and Indigenous American, Filipino, Puerto Rican, South African, Colombian and other nationals are now, like my patient, experiencing planes above or feeling cops walking outside their windows as if they're part of one big murderous machine that they know very intimately. From my vantage both as a clinician and political anthropologist, the protests against US-backed incessant assault on Gaza reflects an emerging revolutionary subjectivity born of massive trauma now coalescing around a singular stage of cruelty. This isn't about individual empathy, an imagined identification with the other as if you are the same as them  a sentimental virtue so often celebrated by white liberalism to validate its sense of its own righteousness while conveniently erasing both history and the otherness of the other and evading any responsibility for stopping violence. It is instead about a collectivization of otherness in a rejection of the Euro-American ""rules-based international order"" that has always depended upon the creation and subordination of supposedly threatening racial, ethnic and sexual others to justify itself. Identifying with the paradigmatic other The identification at play in this collectivity is not with Palestinians nor with Palestinian culture, per se, but rather with the position of the paradigmatic other that the Palestinian people have for so long been forced by Euro-American hegemony, and the Israeli state the latter created and whose military it props up, to occupy. Consider, for instance, how the label ""terrorist"" has so frequently been indiscriminately thrown at Palestinians, from small children to poets, such that US commentators and Israeli officials can unabashedly dismiss, by using these terms, the entire population of Gaza as deserving of death. For migrants vilified as rapists and drug smugglers or Black people called thugs in order to rationalize xenophobic violence and racist policing, for example, such practices are very familiar. It is in this context that queer, trans, Indigenous and Black communities in the US have joined diverse Arab, Muslim, Asian and Jewish communities around the world, including within Israel, to protest Israeli violence and the US administration's shameless support for it. What unites these individuals and groups is not a shared religion or ethnicity nor a cultural worldview but an embodied knowledge of what it feels like to have one's loved ones  present and past  ostracized, demonized and violated simply because they have been marked as a threat to Euro-American power and associated white-supremacist norms. This deep knowledge that derives more from the truth of feeling than from any explicit ideology or identity is now fostering a shared ethical refusal to accept the perpetuation of such violence against others. Otherness and its history demand grief As the writer Viet Thanh Nguyen observed, otherness and its history demand grief. Our ethical challenge in the face of colonial violence and its legacies is to expand grief, ""to make it ever more capacious, rather than reducing it to a singular sorrow. Capacious grief acknowledges that the trauma of the other is neither singular nor unique  that there are other others out there with whom we can share the burden. Perhaps only by expanding our grief will we be able to leave our trauma behind. In sharing our burden  of otherness, we might also transform that burden into a gift."" In accounts shared by my patients, students, colleagues, and friends, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, I see this revolutionary subjectivity and the solidarity it fuels taking shape and gaining force. It's not just about acting on moral principles or historical knowledge of Israeli occupation and Euro-American complicity in a project of ethnic cleansing; it's also about reclaiming power over oneself, taking in one's own family and communal history as confluent with the present, and reasserting the felt truth of one's being and that of one's ancestors in the face of radically dehumanizing violence. It is a refusal to be passively swept along by the systems of oppression that surround us and to which the US government, in particular, continues to display a bipartisan commitment. The burgeoning internationalist movement to free Palestine from violent oppression is not a trendy, transient political cause, as many cynical observers have claimed. It is a collective ethical awakening and formation of an affective community derived from a growing postcolonial consciousness  a transnational reckoning with the still-reverberating legacy of colonial violence and neocolonial manipulations. It is a rekindling recognition that struggles for justice and freedom are necessarily interconnected in both space and time, spanning continents and generations. The voices rising and feet marching each weekend in solidarity with Gaza more than half a year into the slaughter of its communities are not only protesting the specific injustices perpetrated against Palestinians. They are challenging the very foundations of a global economic and associated moral order built on exploitation and the systematic devaluation of some lives to prop up the plainly false image of postcolonial Europe and North America as emblems of benevolence and freedom. The task of freeing Palestine is simultaneously a task of freeing ourselves, of making a world characterized by  in the words of the families of Israeli hostages beseeching Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end his violent campaign against Gaza  an ethics of ""everyone for everyone"". Despite the slogans, we are not all Palestinians. We are instead all radically different from one another, with unique life histories, places in the world, and ways of desiring and living. And it is because of the differences that constitute each one of us and how important it is to protect them that the struggle for Palestinian liberation has become the defining ethical and political matter of our era.

A groundbreaking study published in The Lancet this week reveals a healthcare crisis, with more than half of adults over the age of 30 who have diabetes going untreated. Researchers highlighted the need for better diabetes screening and treatment in low- and middle-income countries, which have seen the sharpest rise in cases since 1990. The analysis was a joint effort between the World Health Organization, or WHO, and the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, a global network of health scientists and researchers that collects and analyzes data on non-communicable disease risk factors. According to the study, the combined prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among adults has surged from 7 percent to 14 percent globally over 30 years. It noted that four nations accounted for more than half of global diabetes cases, with India having the most at 212 million cases, followed by China with 148 million, the US with 42 million, and Pakistan with 36 million. Previous WHO estimates had put the total number of global diabetes cases at 422 million. Pacific island nations, along with parts of the Caribbean, Middle East, and North Africa, reported the highest diabetes rates globally, exceeding 25 percent of adults. Among wealthy Western nations, the US leads with 12.5 percent, followed by the UK at 8.8 percent. While the number of diabetes cases has soared, treatment rates in some regions have remained almost stagnant, the authors noted, even as some higher-income countries have made significant progress, creating an expanding treatment divide. Senior author Majid Ezzati, a professor at Imperial College London, said: ""This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications  including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss- or in some cases, premature death."" The study provides the first worldwide assessment of diabetes trends, drawing from data of more than 1,000 studies involving more than 140 million adults. The findings drew a stark warning from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""We have seen an alarming rise in diabetes over the past three decades, which reflects the increase in obesity, compounded by the impacts of the marketing of unhealthy food, a lack of physical activity, and economic hardshi,"" he said. ""To bring the global diabetes epidemic under control, countries must urgently take action.

That Pakistan obtained one gold medal, in the men's javelin at the Games, the first gold India's neighbor has won at the Olympics in about 40 years, has further spurred the discussions. Some Indians have pointed to the Chinese team's good performance in Paris  China grabbed 40 gold medals the same as the United States  urging the Indian government to heed the lessons of China. That the two countries have similar population size and both are at similar development stages are the major reasons why some Indians have made the comparison.

According to the Indian media, the overall investment in sports in the country is only about 1.13 percent of that of China. Although both are developing economies, the sport market, industry and infrastructure in China are markedly more developed than those in India. China has demonstrated its unique institutional strengths in competitive sports, except soccer. Under its pyramid-style State-run sports system that stretches from the grassroots level to the national teams, China can concentrate its funds and resources to cultivate the most talented athletes standing out from a large talent pool, providing them with scientific and professional training since childhood. Also China attaches great importance to the development of mass sports and youth sports. Efforts in this regard have been made in a systemic way in combination with the country's endeavors to promote national fitness, sports economy and industry. The country has stuck to the two-track model of development in sport long before its dazzling debut in the LA Games in 1984, when it won 15 golds, and ranked fourth on the table in terms of the number of gold medals won. Those in India looking forward to seeing their country overtake China on the medal table of the Olympics should not only focus on the gold medals but China's long-term huge input into the sports sector and relevant industries over the past more than seven decades.

Yousaf, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has been under immense pressure since he ended a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Green Party last week. Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament have tabled two no-confidence votes, one against the first minister and another against the SNP government. ""I have concluded that repairing the relationship across the political divide can only be done with someone else at the helm,"" Yousaf told a press conference in Edinburgh.

After a decade of grand promises, billions of dollars in investments and countless ribbon-cutting ceremonies, the question remains: has the megaproject truly delivered, or are we merely giving it a new coat of paint? CPEC was formally launched on July 5, 2013, during a visit by the Pakistani prime minister to China. The initial announcement laid the groundwork for a broader framework of economic cooperation between the two countries. Momentum picked up in April 2015, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan, marking the inauguration of the first set of CPEC projects with significant agreements to enhance the initiative's scope and scale. The vision was simple: a network of roads, railways, ports, and energy projects that would transform Pakistan into an economic powerhouse, all while giving China direct access to the Arabian Sea. On paper, it was a win-win for both nations. Fast forward to 2024, and the results are mixed. Over the past decade, more than $30 billion worth of infrastructure projects have been completed, including the Gwadar port, various power projects, and roads connecting Pakistan with Western China. Thirteen power projects have been completed, and a 4,000-megawatt electricity transmission line now supports roughly one-third of Pakistan's power grid. Transportation infrastructure, including key roads, ports, and even the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train, has seen significant improvements. China has poured over $25 billion into direct investments, and if the official narrative is to be believed, CPEC has created more than 230,000 jobs. Despite these successes, the road has been far from smooth. The development of nine planned Special Economic Zones, which were to be the centerpieces of Pakistan's industrial revolution, has been hit by delays. Only four of these zones are currently under construction, and the expected industrial relocation from China to Pakistan has yet to materialize. Debt concerns have also cast a long shadow. Security remains another thorny issue, particularly in Balochistan, where key CPEC projects are based. Despite enhanced security measures, terrorist attacks on Chinese nationals and infrastructure projects have persisted, stalling progress and deterring potential investors. The recent attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi has once again posed challenges to Islamabad and Beijing, and put Pakistan's security apparatus under severe scrutiny. With the Shanghai Cooperation Organization conference held on Tuesday and Wednesday, the timing couldn't be worse. And security is not just a local issue. The West's narrative around CPEC has been consistently negative. With the West overtly and covertly pressuring Pakistan to back out of CPEC, the project has stopped being just an economic venture and turned into a battlefield of narratives and perceptions. Enter CPEC 2.0, the next phase of this ambitious endeavor, promising a shift in focus from infrastructure to industrial cooperation, agriculture, socio-economic development, and information technology. It sounds promising  a sign that both Islamabad and Beijing are keen to address gaps and learn from past mistakes. For CPEC 2.0 to succeed, both Pakistan and China need to make some tough decisions. First and foremost, political stability and good governance are essential. It is the responsibility of Pakistan's civil government to take the lead on this by ensuring that democratic institutions are strengthened and competent professionals are placed in key positions. CPEC cannot be treated as a political football, with each new government fiddling with its priorities and stalling progress. There needs to be cross-party consensus on the importance of this project to ensure it stays on track regardless of who is in power. Secondly, it is time to prioritize. Instead of spreading resources thin across too many sectors, the focus should be on completing key projects that can deliver immediate benefits. Industrial cooperation and job creation are great goals, but they need to be backed by real, tangible investments and incentives. Thirdly, local capacity-building is crucial. Pakistan's industrial base is weak, and its workforce is under-skilled. If CPEC is to deliver on its promises, there needs to be a concerted effort to invest in vocational training, technology transfer and capacity improvements. It is not enough to rely on Chinese expertise; Pakistan needs to develop its own. A country that cannot stand on its own feet is always going to lean on another. Finally, security concerns need to be addressed head-on. The situation in Balochistan will not improve overnight; it needs a holistic approach that goes beyond simply deploying more troops. The rule of law and apolitical policing are the only answers. Engaging with local communities, addressing their grievances, and making them stakeholders in CPEC's success is key to ensuring the long-term viability of these projects. Simultaneously, countering hostile narratives and leveraging cultural connections will be essential in maintaining momentum and securing the trust of the local population. Law enforcement agencies should stop merely reacting to incidents and take security measures proactively. What's needed is not just more officers on the ground, but a strategic overhaul of Pakistan's approach to securing foreign nationals. CPEC 2.0 is both a challenge and an opportunity. It is a chance for Pakistan to finally capitalize on its strategic location and build a more vigorous, diversified economy. But it's also a reminder that the road to economic transformation is fraught with obstacles, many of them self-inflicted.

In its monitor, the IMF said the global public debt in 2024 is expected to be $100 trillion, accounting for 93 percent of global GDP, and to keep rising through the end of the decade, approaching 100 percent of GDP by 2030. A day earlier, the IMF\'s World Economic Outlook had raised the alarm over global public debt, warning that ""risks to the debt outlook are heavily tilted to the upside"". Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMF\'s fiscal affairs department, highlighted the ""debt-at-risk"" framework and how it helps policymakers determine the risk of high levels of debt. ""Assessing and managing public debt risks is a major task for policymakers. The Fiscal Monitor makes a major contribution  the \'debt-at-risk\' framework. It considers the distribution of outcomes around the most likely scenario. The analysis in the Fiscal Monitor shows that debt risks are substantially worse than they look from the baseline alone,"" said Gaspar during the 2024 Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group, which are being held from Monday to Saturday in Washington, bringing together finance ministers and central bankers from nearly 200 countries and regions. Preemptive action ""The framework should help policymakers take preemptive action to avoid the most adverse outcomes."" According to Gaspar and the monitor report, there are three main drivers of debt risks. First, spending pressures from long-term underlying trends, but also challenging politics at national, continental and global levels. Second, optimistic bias in debt projections. Third, increasing uncertainty is associated with economic, financial and political developments. Gaspar said the key is to take action to control debt and keep at it. ""Waiting is risky. The longer you wait, the greater the risk. The debt becomes unsustainable,"" he said. ""At the same time, countries that can afford it should avoid cutting too much, too fast. That would hurt growth and jobs. That is why, in many cases, we recommend an enduring but gradual fiscal adjustment,"" said Gaspar. Gaspar said China ""has ample policy space"" and the means to keep public debt under control. Among his suggestions, Gaspar noted it\'s ""very important that fiscal policy and structural policy promote the transition to a new growth model in China"", based on a technological innovation model that supports the structural transformation toward a green economy. ""My understanding is that this fourth element has been emphasized by the political authorities in China at the highest level,"" Gaspar added. In an interview with AFP on Monday, Gaspar said ""China is in the process of a major transition"". ""Fiscal capacity can help China reach a different plateau in terms of its economic ambition, in terms of its economic prosperity,"" he said, referring to China\'s ""very strong fiscal capacity to act"". Gaspar also said China should be looking to implement fiscal policies to boost its growth. ""For a continental economy like China, the main driver of growth and development has to be domestic."" Murtaza Syed, head of ecosystem at the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, who is also a former acting governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, said that ""there are certain buffers that China has"". Syed said China\'s debt is basically domestic. ""It\'s almost one part of the State balance sheet owing the other part of the State balance sheet because you\'ve got a lot of State-owned commercial banks, you\'ve got local governments, and you\'ve got a central government that actually has a lot of space to do things,"" he said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/25/671af88ca310f1268d837f1b.jpeg'],"['The International Monetary Fund logo is seen outside its headquarters in Washington, US, Sept 4, 2018.

53,Inclusive Shanghai Spirit guides SCO,"('Pakistan', 'Islamabad')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\17\WS6710411ba310f1265a1c7fbc.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/17/WS6710411ba310f1265a1c7fbc.html,"Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the 23rd Meeting of the Council of Heads of Government of Member States of the SCO in Islamabad and paid an official visit to Pakistan from Monday to Thursday. The SCO heads of government meeting in Islamabad presented the opportunity to reflect on the significance of the SCO as a regional organization as well as its leadership which has been pivotal in shaping its future. Pakistan, under Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif's leadership, presided over the SCO meeting in Islamabad, focusing on economic cooperation, environmental sustainability and cultural and people-to-people linkages. This reflects Pakistan's growing role in the SCO as a country committed to fostering regional stability and development. The SCO's focus on combating terrorism, facilitating economic integration, and intensifying people-to-people exchanges is in line with Pakistan's priorities. Hence, the country is well-positioned to contribute to the SCO's future growth. It should be noted that under Chinese President Xi Jinping's guidance, the SCO has adhered to the Shanghai Spirit, which emphasizes mutual benefit, consultation, and respect for diversity  a model that contrasts sharply with partnerships and alliances built on the basis of hegemony. To begin with, the top Chinese leader has consistently emphasized the importance of multilateral cooperation, common development, peace and a more representative global governance system. He prioritizes regional peace and development through mechanisms such as the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation. The treaty exemplifies the SCO prefers peace and dialogue over conflict. The Islamabad meeting further strengthened these commitments, and explored new avenues of cooperation, particularly in economic and cultural exchanges. Pakistan's participation in the SCO has been marked by a commitment to safeguarding regional security and promoting development, and the SCO meeting in Islamabad demonstrated the country's commitment to enhance multilateral cooperation in the region. The organization has undertaken joint counter-terrorism exercises and border control operations, and established mechanisms to curb cybercrime, drug trafficking and transnational organized crime. Pakistan, as a key player in these initiatives, has benefited immensely from the SCO's collective security framework, and the just-concluded meeting demonstrated its willingness to enhance security cooperation in the face of evolving threats. Guided by the Shanghai spirit, the SCO has facilitated trade and investment among member states, with the resulting economic integration being a testament to the SCO's efficiency and its focus on improving the lives of peoples in other SCO member countries. Initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative have further enhanced economic connectivity, promoting infrastructure development, trade, and technological advancement across the region. To Pakistan, the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor offer significant opportunities for economic growth. In fact, the SCO meeting in Islamabad explored ways to further align the development policies of SCO member states in order to advance trade, increase investment and deepen digital cooperation. China's call for deeper integration in areas such as the digital economy, green energy and modern agriculture is particularly important for Pakistan, as it seeks to diversify its economy and create new growth drivers. The SCO places great emphasis on cultural and people-to-people exchanges. This aspect of the SCO's work is crucial for fostering mutual understanding and friendship among its diverse member states. Initiatives such as the SCO University, SCO Youth Forum, and various cultural and educational exchange programs have helped bridge the cultural divides and strengthen the bonds between the peoples of SCO member countries. Pakistan's rich cultural heritage and its long history of friendship with China provide a strong foundation for these exchanges, with the Islamabad meeting giving Pakistan a great opportunity to expand people-to-people programs. As the world undergoes profound changes, from shifting geopolitical dynamics to climate change, the role of the SCO in maintaining global stability has never been more important. The SCO is marked by a commitment to multilateralism and international justice. Pakistan, as a member of the SCO, stands to benefit from this multilateral approach, not least because the organization provides Pakistan with a platform to engage with regional powers on an equal footing, addressing common challenges and seizing opportunities for development. China's vision for the SCO is one of shared prosperity and mutual respect, which ensures the SCO remains a key player in global governance, and a promoter of a fairer and more representative world order. As Pakistan takes its place at the forefront of the SCO, it is poised to play a vital role in shaping the future of this important organization, working alongside China and the other member states to build a more secure and prosperous world.

""If they (the Israelis) reconsider their behavior, accept a cease-fire and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response,"" Pezeshkian said during a cabinet meeting, Iran\'s official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. However, Teheran ""will not leave unanswered any aggression against its sovereignty and security"", he added. ""Today, all countries in the region have come to this conclusion that the Islamic Republic of Iran seeks to establish peace and stability while Israel is seeking to exacerbate crisis and war in the region."" He also lashed out at the double standards of the United States and European countries in regard to the spread of crisis in the region, Mehr News Agency reported. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei on Monday criticized what he called the US\' ""destabilizing presence"" after the deployment of B-52 bombers in the region. ""We have always believed that the presence of America in the region is a destabilizing presence,"" Baghaei told a news conference in response to a question about the deployment, adding it ""will not deter (Iran\'s) resolve to defend itself"". Commemorating the National Day of Fighting Global Arrogance on Sunday, Pezeshkian said Iran has never initiated a war or advised any country to go to war. It has always been the US that has ignited war in various parts of the world, he added. Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad in Pakistan, told China Daily that there has been a careful balancing act by Iran, given its emphasis on economic recovery and sustainable development in the post-pandemic era. ""Domestically, the Iranian government must project strength to maintain deterrence and reassure its population of its resolve amid external pressures. This response serves a dual purpose: It communicates Iran\'s strategic positioning to its domestic audience while demonstrating to the international community that, although its priority may be stability, it won\'t shy away from assertive measures when necessary,"" she said. Letter to UNSC Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Sunday that Turkiye, along with 53 other signatories, has submitted a joint letter to the United Nations Security Council urging it to take immediate action to stop the flow of arms to Israel, state news agency Anadolu reported. ""This limitless aggression is threatening world regional stability and international order,"" Fidan said. ""We all have a moral responsibility to push forward a two-state solution to ensure the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people."" Siddiqa said Turkiye\'s move marks a ""commendable"" stance. While its intentions align with a broader desire for peace, it is clear that a collective, multilateral approach is essential for any real shift, she said, noting that Ankara itself faces its own complex challenges with terrorism. ""Moreover, the underlying issue remains Israel\'s strategic backing from the US, a primary factor preventing meaningful consensus on Gaza,"" she said, adding that without a shift in support from ""Israel\'s main backer"", the dynamics ""are unlikely to change on Gaza"". Both US presidential candidates  Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump  have promised to end the conflict in Gaza should they win the tightly watched, neck-and-neck election on Tuesday. ""In the current landscape, where Israel is bolstered by unwavering US support, genuine progress toward peace requires broader international intervention,"" Siddiqa said. In another development, Israel formally notified the UN of its decision to sever ties with UNRWA, the Palestinian refugees agency, it said on Monday, after lawmakers voted to ban the organization vital to the occupied territories.

According to the statement released by BIS announcing the move, these additions are related to alleged violations of export controls, involvement in weapons programs of concern, and evasion of US sanctions and export controls on Russia and Iran. The bureau claims that the six Chinese entities were added to the list for acquiring US-origin items in support of China\'s military modernization, dilatory and evasive conduct during end-use checks, and procurement of US-origin items for Iran\'s ""weapons of mass destruction"" and unmanned aerial vehicle programs. Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez said: ""Our actions today send a message to malicious actors that if they violate our controls, they will pay a price."" The additions to the list under the excuse of protecting ""national security"" represent the latest move the US side has taken to safeguard its hegemony. By resorting to long-arm jurisdiction and unilateral sanctions in this way, the US undermines the international trade order and rules, hinders normal international economic and trade exchanges, and threatens the security and stability of the global industry and supply chains. Previously, the US had added many Chinese entities to its Entity List for allegedly violating its unilateral sanctions on Russia. It added 42 Chinese entities, along with hundreds of entities from other countries, to the Entity List in late August for that reason. While the US has introduced a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine and Israel, it has made groundless accusations against the normal Sino-Russian and Sino-Iranian economic and trade exchanges. This practice is extremely hypocritical and irresponsible. Whether on the Ukraine crisis or the Middle East crisis, China has always maintained an objective and fair position, actively advocated for peace and promoted talks, and facilitated political solutions. China is not the creator of or party to the two crises and it has never added fuel to the fire or taken advantage of them to serve its own interests. It must be pointed out that China's right to conduct normal economic and trade exchanges with countries around the world, including Russia and Iran, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit must not be interfered with or undermined, and China's legitimate rights and interests must not be violated. More important, the US does not have the legitimacy to try and interfere in China's modernization of its military, which is an important power safeguarding regional and world peace. On the contrary, it is the US and its allies and proxies that have been continuously provoking China over the Taiwan question and South China Sea issues at the costs of regional peace and stability.

The closest and highest quality men's 100-meter race and a late-night pole vault world record lit up the first week, while Sifan Hassan's final-day marathon win, to cap a barely believable hat-trick of medals, was a fitting way to bring down the curtain. ""It\'s been fantastic and I think the quality of athletics at the moment is almost beyond description,"" Sebastian Coe, head of World Athletics said this week. ""I can\'t remember a time when we\'ve had such a bandwidth of excellence."" Nowhere was that more visible than in the men's 100m, where Noah Lyles caught Kishane Thompson on the line to win by five thousandths of a second in 9.79. The six men behind them also ran a sub-10 second 100m  the first time that has happened in a legal race. Lyles, the sport's biggest showman, was unable to double up, taking bronze in the 200m, and then revealing he was running with COVID. Instead, Botswana's quiet assassin Letsile Tebogo became the first African to win it. The United States delivered a world record in the rarely-run mixed 4x400m relay, but Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone's obliteration of her own world record to win the 400m hurdles was of a different magnitude. Mondo Duplantis also beat his own pole vault world record in a moment of great theater at the Stade de France. With all other events finished, and the Swede's expected gold long pocketed, he failed twice at 6.25m before sailing clear to a stupendous roar. Coe hoped the men\'s 1,500m would be a ""race for the ages"" and it was  though not in the way he or anyone else expected. Briton Josh Kerr ran the race of his life to get past defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen, only for long-shot, American Cole Hocker, to come past them both and win with a huge personal best to produce one of the biggest upsets of the Games. Ingebrigtsen bounced back to win the 5,000m, while in the women's 1,500m, Kenya's peerless Faith Kipyegon completed an unprecedented hat-trick. Medals galore over the shorter distances has usually been the norm for the US, but it found remarkable success in all sorts of events in Paris. When Yared Nuguse took bronze behind Hocker, it was the first time in 112 years that two Americans had medaled in the 1,500m. Grant Fisher went toe-to-toe with the mighty Africans to win impressive bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m while Kenneth Rooks did the same for a notable 3,000m steeplechase silver. After relatively slim pickings in Tokyo, the US was back in charge, with 14 gold, 11 silver and nine bronze medals to set it up for hosting the next Games in Los Angeles. In contrast, Jamaica had a torrid time, barely featuring in the sprints it has dominated for years, and its solitary gold medal was a shock discus win for Roje Stona. The host also had a campaign to forget, despite the nightly roars of support from fantastic fans who filled every session. It was saved from a total wipe-out by Cyrena Samba-Mayela's silver in the 100m hurdles on the final night of track action. There was still one more event to go, however, and it provided a fabulous, and scarcely believable, finale, as Dutchwoman Hassan won the women's marathon after taking bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m. She was the first woman to even attempt the treble, let alone medal in all three, and now stands alongside athletics royalty in the shape of Emil Zatopek, who won all three in 1952. Forty-three countries won athletics medals, with Saint Lucia, Dominica and Pakistan doing so for the first time, all golds, via Julien Alfred in the women's 100, Thea LaFond in the women's triple jump and Arshad Nadeem in the men's javelin.

59,Marine Eco-Environmental Protection in China,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202407\12\WS66906939a31095c51c50dad6_7.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/12/WS66906939a31095c51c50dad6.html,"VII. Carrying Out All-Round International Cooperation on Marine Eco-Environmental Protection Marine issues are global issues, and protecting the marine eco-environment is a common concern for people all over the world. In 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment adopted the Declaration on the Human Environment, which included conservation of the marine environment in its 26 principles and initiated global action on marine environmental protection. In 1982, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea adopted the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), opening a new chapter in global marine governance and providing comprehensive and systematic provisions for marine environmental protection. The international community has steadily advanced global ocean protection by establishing a series of marine environmental protection agreements. Countries around the world are building consensus and working in synergy to address the risks and challenges facing the marine eco-environment, striving to make the oceans clean and beautiful. China is committed to the vision of a maritime community of shared future, and conducts in-depth mutually beneficial cooperation with the international community through multiple channels and in various forms, contributing Chinese wisdom to global marine eco-environmental protection. 1. Actively fulfilling obligations and participating in global governance To promote the wellbeing of humanity, China actively plays its role as a major country, and diligently fulfills its responsibilities and obligations under international maritime conventions through concrete action. Diligently fulfilling its responsibilities and obligations under international maritime conventions. The marine eco-environment encompasses topics in a wide range of areas. China supports advancing global marine eco-environmental protection through a holistic approach, and actively promotes the implementation of UNCLOS and other international conventions concerning the sea. In May 1996, China ratified and became a party to UNCLOS, opening a new chapter in the country's participation in global maritime governance. In addition, China has demonstrated its determination and commitment to marine protection in broader and more detailed areas by joining more than 30 multilateral treaties related to oceans, including the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, and the Antarctic Treaty. Under the framework of international conventions, China has established a policy system surrounding marine eco-environmental protection, resource conservation, and management of polar activities. It carries out voluntary fishing moratoriums on high seas and fulfills its environmental protection obligations, including performing environmental impact assessment for its Antarctic expeditions. China has also participated in the UN regular assessment of the state of the global marine environment, and released regular progress reports on the implementation of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, national reports on the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and national communications on climate change, presenting to the international community China's actions and progress in marine eco-environmental protection and resource conservation, and making tangible contributions by fulfilling its obligations under various conventions. Integrating into and promoting global ocean governance. China actively participates in the establishment of global maritime governance mechanisms and promotes a more just and reasonable global maritime governance system. It works hard to integrate into multilateral governance, and actively participates in the affairs of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IOC), the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). China plays an active role in the Conference of the Parties to the UNCLOS, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), and other agendas. Since 2012, China has submitted more than 120 proposals, independently or jointly, to relevant polar international organizations, and over 700 proposals to the IMO and other international organizations, engaging itself extensively in the formulation of relevant rules and regulations for environmental protection and resource conservation. It has advanced the formulation of ISA's regulations on exploration and development, the negotiation of agreements and regulations on fisheries under the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), the negotiation of an internationally legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, and other multilateral processes. China was also heavily involved in the negotiation and implementation of the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean, and contributed significantly to the negotiations on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) and its signing as a treaty, which took nearly 20 years to reach consensus. Overall, China has made an outstanding contribution to global ocean governance. 2. Expanding ""circle of friends"" for maritime cooperation Addressing global marine eco-environmental issues remains a long-term and arduous task that requires extensive global participation and collaborative efforts. China upholds multilateralism, and has developed blue partnerships through an open and pragmatic approach. It works with the international community to build a sea of prosperity and beauty for all countries. Building extensive blue partnerships. On a voluntary and cooperative basis, China has worked with other countries to establish a global blue partnership characterized by consultation and joint contribution. In 2017, China called for building a blue partnership at the first UN Ocean Conference, designed to promote international cooperation on ""cherishing our ocean and protecting our blue home"". The proposal was then made formal with China announcing the Vision for Maritime Cooperation Under the Belt and Road Initiative. In September 2021, ""actively promoting the establishment of a blue partnership"" was designated by the High-level Dialogue on Global Development as one of the specific measures taken by China under the framework of the Global Development Initiative (GDI). At the 2022 UN Ocean Conference, China released the Blue Partnership Principles and launched the Sustainable Blue Partnership Cooperation Network and the Blue Partnership Fund, for joint action in the protection and sustainable utilization of the sea and its resources. Currently, China has signed intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements on marine cooperation with more than 50 countries and international organizations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing significantly to cooperation on global marine eco-environmental protection. Expanding platforms and mechanisms for maritime cooperation. China prioritizes marine eco-environmental protection as a key area of cooperation, taking the initiative to establish new platforms and mechanisms and build consensus among all parties. Leading cooperation with platform building as the foundation, China has taken a lead in establishing and operating the East Asia Marine Cooperation Platform and the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Center. These platforms conduct practical cooperation with East Asian and ASEAN countries on marine scientific research, eco-environmental protection, and disaster prevention and mitigation. It has built relevant mechanisms for international organizations in China, including the APEC Marine Sustainable Development Center and the United Nations Decade Collaborative Center on Ocean-Climate Nexus, coordinating global innovation and cooperation in the ocean and climate fields, facilitating the sharing and exchanges of beneficial experience in marine eco-environmental protection, and playing an important role in jointly protecting the marine ecosystems. Advocating and guiding bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Championing the principle of planning together, building together and benefiting together, China has continued to expand areas of international cooperation, conducting dialogue and exchanges on multilateral platforms. It has held the Thematic Forum on Maritime Cooperation of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the World Coastal Forum, the Eco Forum Global Guiyang, and the China-ASEAN Environmental Cooperation Forum, advancing cooperation towards new progress in eco-environmental protection and restoration, disaster monitoring and early warning, and marine plastic pollution prevention and control. China attaches great importance to mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between countries, and has established long-term bilateral cooperation mechanisms with many countries in many fields. It actively provides technical support to other developing countries, and has established joint marine research centers, laboratories, and observation stations with Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Jamaica, playing a positive role in strengthening marine eco-environmental protection in other developing countries. China works with other countries to carry out research on endangered marine species, joint environmental surveys in the Yellow Sea, coral reef monitoring and data collection, and prevention and control of marine litter and microplastic pollution. The results from these programs have injected more impetus to regional marine eco-environmental protection. 3. Expanding cooperation in deep-sea and polar scientific expedition Protecting deep-sea and polar eco-environments is the common responsibility of humanity. As an important participant, vigorous promoter, and active practitioner in deep-sea and polar affairs, China takes a leading role in international deep-sea and polar exploration and research, working together with the international community to promote sustainable development of these regions. Jointly advancing deep-sea research and exploration. China actively takes part in international seabed affairs, coordinates deep-sea surveys, and strengthens the protection of the deep-sea eco-environment. It has conducted more than 80 scientific research voyages in the deep sea, going on joint scientific expeditions with Russia, Japan, Nigeria, Seychelles, and Indonesia, and contributing to a better understanding of deep-sea ecosystems. For more than 10 consecutive years since 2011, based on its studies in the field of earth science, China has submitted seabed naming proposals to the Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN), of which 261 have been approved, contributing to a clearer understanding of the deep-sea geography. Based on the results of its investigation of deep-sea biological resources, China has also set up a marine microorganism bank that leads the world in inventory and number of species, helping humans to expand their understanding of biological life processes in the deep sea. Jointly expanding understanding of polar regions. China is committed to protecting the natural environment of the North and South Poles in accordance with international law, and actively participates in international cooperation to address environmental challenges and climate change for these regions. At the 40th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), China took the lead in jointly proposing the Green Expedition Initiative with more than ten countries, and the initiative was ultimately passed as a resolution to open a new chapter of Antarctic expedition. China has built five Antarctic research stations, and two Arctic research stations in Norway and Iceland, which serve as important platforms for several thousand scientists to carry out polar observation, biological monitoring, and glacier research. Additionally, it has organized 13 scientific expeditions in the Arctic Ocean and 40 in the Antarctic, while signing memorandums of understanding or joint statements with the United States, Russia, Australia, Iceland, and New Zealand and carrying out international cooperation with more than 10 countries. It is a key participant in the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC)  the largest Arctic scientific research program  and plays a leading role in advancing international cooperation on the Joint Arctic Scientific Middle-Ocean Ridge Insight Expedition (JASMInE).China works with other countries to undertake the tasks of the Antarctic RINGS (Ice Sheet Margin) Action Group under the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and has made positive contributions to a deeper understanding of polar regions on global marine ecosystems. 4. Providing extensive foreign assistance and training Facing a deteriorating marine eco-environment, all countries are members of a community of shared future. China stands in solidarity with the international community and carries out cooperation with it. While pursuing its own development, it also brings more benefits to other countries and peoples, contributing its share to global marine eco-environmental protection. Providing extensive foreign assistance. China has provided support and assistance to the best of its ability to other developing countries in addressing marine eco-environmental issues through various means. In 2012, it launched the Marine Scholarship of China program, which has enabled over 300 students from 45 countries, including Belt and Road partners, to obtain master's or doctoral degrees in oceanography and other related fields, helping other developing countries to cultivate professionals in marine sciences and management. It has provided technical assistance in marine spatial planning, marine economic planning, and sea level rise assessment to Thailand, Cambodia, and Cape Verde, and has held workshops on ocean dumping management technology under the London Convention and its 1996 Protocol, to help grow an awareness of the sea and provide the technology for marine eco-environmental protection for African and Latin American nations. Actively carrying out foreign training. In order to provide a platform for marine education, training, and public awareness in developing countries, China has established several education centers, including the China-ISA Joint Training and Research Center, the China Western Pacific Center of the International Ocean Institute (IOC), the IOC Regional Training and Research Center on Ocean Dynamics and Climate (ODC), and the Tianjin Regional Training Center of the Ocean Teacher Global Academy (OTGA). As a positive contributor to improving the technical capabilities of scientific researchers in related fields in developing countries, it hosts various events in which participants share knowledge and practical experience on integrated coastal zone management, ocean governance, and marine eco-environmental protection, and provides training in this field for about 500 people every year. Conclusion Oceans constitute a blue home that ensures the survival of humanity. In the face of the global challenge to the marine eco-environment, humanity forms a community of shared future, and shares a common responsibility to protect the marine eco-environment and ensure its sustainable development. Today, as China embarks on a new journey of rejuvenating the Chinese nation through Chinese modernization, the country's maritime endeavors have entered an era of historic opportunities. Protecting the marine eco-environment has become an essential requirement and fundamental guarantee for building China into a strong maritime country and achieving harmony between humans and the sea.

The samples from the far side of the moon will give scientists a better understanding of the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon. The Chang'e 6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e 5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner. According to the mission plan, after it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours of its touchdown on the lunar surface, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit. The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, according to the China National Space Administration. The Chang'e 6 mission has required new technological breakthroughs in such areas as lunar retrograde orbit design and control, rapid intelligent sampling, and takeoff from the far side of the moon. Notably, the Chang'e 6 mission is carrying four payloads developed through international cooperation, highlighting how China's space program is providing more opportunities for the world's scientists and promoting international cooperation in space exploration. Scientific instruments from France, Italy, the European Space Agency and Sweden are aboard the Chang'e 6 lander, and a small satellite from Pakistan is aboard the orbiter. More than 300 kilograms of lunar samples have been retrieved over the course of 10 lunar missions carried out by the United States, the former Soviet Union and China, and all were collected from the moon's near side. Remote-sensing images show the moon's two sides are very different. The near side is relatively flat, while the far side is thickly dotted with asteroid impact craters of different sizes and has much fewer lunar mares than the near side. Scientists also suspect that the lunar crust on the far side is much thicker than that on the near side. But why that is so remains a mystery. -Xinhua news agency",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202405/06/66381ed7a31082fc2b6d4f66.jpeg'],"['A Long March 5 rocket, carrying the Chang\'e 6 spacecraft, blasts off from its launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Site in South China\'s Hainan province, May 3, 2024.

Ever since the title became available online at the beginning of April, its easy-to-read language and warm illustrations have helped children across China learn about how the virus spreads, all the while offering scientific protection measures. Aside from readers from China, more and more young readers (and their parents) around the world are benefiting from the philanthropic website Life Tree Books , initiated by Zhang Mingzhou, president of IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People). Eleven original works by China, selected by a jury of experts, translated into 13 languages, including Japanese, French and Russian, are available for readers to enjoy, all free of charge. The website is part of Zhang\'s philanthropic program called ""Picture Books about COVID-19 for Children Around the World"", which he launched on February 29 to help youngsters fight against the pandemic through reading picture books on the coronavirus. ""Ever since the pandemic, quite a number of children have been forced to remain indoors. There is a shortage of information (on the pandemic) suitable for children to understand. Negative emotions including not knowing, fear, loneliness and anxiety are surrounding and troubling them,"" Zhang said. He pleaded for publishers to donate publishing rights of books on the novel coronavirus and invited adept translators to translate these works into foreign languages. In just a few days, Zhang received donated copyrights from more than 50 publishing houses, authors and illustrators from China, and more than 300 volunteer translators who are able to work with more than 10 languages. ""We then spent about a month to launch the website. It is the collaborated fruit of translators, web designers, programmers and legal experts,"" Zhang said. ""Scientific knowledge is integrated with literature, so children can read an interesting story and learn about science in a natural fashion,"" Liu Lei, deputy editor in chief of Qingdao Publishing Group, said.

62,Nadeem rewarded for record throw,"('Pakistan', 'Pakistani', 'Islamabad')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\15\WS66bd599ba3104e74fddba119.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/15/WS66bd599ba3104e74fddba119.html," ISLAMABAD  Olympic javelin gold medalist Arshad Nadeem received a total of 250 million rupees ($897,000) on Tuesday as Pakistan continued to celebrate his record-breaking throw at the Paris Games. Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, announced 150 million rupees ($538,000) for Nadeem at a special ceremony to honor the star athlete in Islamabad. Sharif's announcement came hours after Punjab's chief minister Maryam Nawaz visited Nadeem's house, and presented him with a check for 100 million rupees. Nawaz also handed him the keys to a new car, which has a special registration number of ""PAK 92.97"" to commemorate Nadeem\'s throw of 92.97 meters in Paris, which was an Olympic record. Nadeem\'s coach Salman Iqbal Butt was also given 5 million rupees. ""You have doubled the delight of 250 million Pakistanis because we\'ll also celebrate our Independence Day tomorrow,"" Sharif said while announcing the money for Nadeem, whose father is a daily wage laborer. ""Today every Pakistani is happy and the morale of the whole country is sky high."" ""The feeling is very good,"" Nadeem said Tuesday. ""I hope to stay fit and break the world record one day."" Last Thursday, Nadeem set off celebrations across Pakistan when his throw easily surpassed the previous Olympic mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008. It was also well clear of India's Neeraj Chopra, the Tokyo champion, who reached a season-best 89.45 for silver. ""Arshad Nadeem has brought unprecedented happiness to the nation,"" Nawaz said in a statement. Nadeem's Olympic gold is Pakistan's first since the men's field hockey team won 40 years ago at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Pakistan's last medal of any color was a field hockey bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Later Tuesday, Nadeem and his family were flown to Islamabad on a special flight from Multan to attend a reception hosted by Sharif, who paid tribute to the athlete during a cabinet meeting. ""Nadeem has elevated the name of Pakistan worldwide because of his days and nights of hard work, parents\' prayers and coach\'s training,"" Sharif said. Pakistan is predominantly known for cricket in the sporting world, with the country winning the 1992 World Cup. ""Seeing him on the podium waving the flag and ringing the Olympic bell was incredible,"" Pakistan cricket captain Shan Masood said on Tuesday, as he prepares for a Test series against Bangladesh, starting Aug 21 in Rawalpindi. Pakistan head coach Jason Gillespie said Nadeem will be invited to the dressing room of the Pakistan cricket team during the first Test match. ""Having him visit and share his gold medal with the team would be a fantastic boost, especially with the Olympic spirit still in the air,"" Gillespie said. ""It was a wonderful moment."" A special postage stamp has also been issued in Nadeem's honor depicting his record throw.

66,New quality productive forces spur global development,"('Islamabad',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\20\WS66c4599da31060630b92407b.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/20/WS66c4599da31060630b92407b.html,"The third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in July was in the global spotlight for the reform measures it proposed to advance Chinese modernization. The plenum decided to improve the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions and pinpointed the key areas. The reforms will give impetus to both China's development and global common prosperity. China's new quality productive forces theory and actions taken vis--vis them indicate the development path of Chinese socialism and are a Chinese solution for win-win cooperation and common development by sharing development opportunities. New Methodology for Global Growth Since China began reform and opening up more than four decades ago, it has speeded up industrialization, reaching the level that took developed countries more than a century to accomplish. Chinese modernization, based on China's unique conditions and underpinned by a world view nourished by a millennia-old culture, has blazed an economic path suitable to China. The essential requirement of Chinese modernization is high-quality development, with the focus on developing new quality productive forces. Labor productivity, a measure of economic performance, compares the output with the amount of labor used to produce that output. The concept was pioneered by Western economists represented by Adam Smith. Karl Marx elucidated the fundamental role of productive forces in advancing social progress, based on which the Marxist productivity theory was formed. As China entered a new era of development, the central leadership with President Xi Jinping at the core has made major theoretical innovations regarding productivity. As a new type of social productivity, new quality productive forces are characterized by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality. The theory is in line with the new development philosophy, inheriting the Marxist productivity theory and combining the development needs of the new era for innovative development. It's a forward-looking economic theory to guide the transformative change of global economic development. Egyptian writer Khaled Azab, who is also press attach of Bibliotheca Alexandrina, once said China's experience not only represents a development model, but presents a new development theory aimed to build a huge global market interconnected internally and externally, going far beyond the thinking of hegemonic economy. Committed to the principle of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs, China has provided preferential international loans without any strings attached, and established industrial parks in many developing countries, which have received widespread appreciation. Rising China, as a new type of major country, will open a new chapter of development. That new quality productive forces theory will become a major methodology for world economic development is a conclusion supported by both its theoretical connotation and China's development achievements in related sectors. The first half of 2024 saw 39 out of China's 41 major industries register growth year on year. The value added of China's high-tech manufacturing surged by 8.7 percent year on year, 2.7 percentage points higher than that of industrial enterprises above the designated size. The Global Innovation Index 2023 released by the World Intellectual Property Organization placed China 12th in the innovation rankings, leading the middle-income economies. According to Chandran Nair, founder and CEO of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, a pan-Asian think tank, market demand and several other factors, like the need to protect the ecology, are driving China's development transformation. Its complete sci-tech innovation system has laid a solid foundation for new quality productive forces, which will help better meet people's expectations for a better life. Advancing High-Standard Opening Up The development of new quality productive forces is both vital for China's development transformation and upgrading and boosting global growth. President Xi has stressed on multiple occasions that high-standard opening up should be expanded to create a sound international environment for the development of new quality productive forces. Despite the turbulence in the international geopolitical landscape, China's determination to build a high-standard open economy remains unchanged. China, now the world's largest renewable energy market and biggest renewable energy equipment manufacturer, exports its wind and photovoltaic products to more than 200 countries and regions. According to the Renewable Capacity Statistics 2024 released by the International Renewable Energy Agency, over the past 10 years, the average cost per kilowatt-hour of global wind and photovoltaic power generation projects decreased by more than 60 percent and 80 percent respectively. Chinese innovation, manufacturing and engineering played a predominant role in that. In 2023, China\'s tech-intensive and green ""new three""  new-energy vehicles, solar batteries, and lithium-ion batteries  saw their total export exceed RMB 1 trillion for the first time. The development of new quality productive forces has enabled more people worldwide to enjoy the convenience and benefits of clean, reliable and affordable energy products. China has given new impetus to global sustainable development with its experience in innovation. Erik Solheim, co-chair of the Europe-Asia Center and former under-secretary-general of the United Nations, said, ""I am very optimistic that these new, high quality, high-tech, productive forces would be a huge step forward for humans, can make much better and lower-cost products. And we can do it in a much more environment-friendly way."" As globalization deepens and resource allocation in the world changes, China's high-standard opening up promises to create a favorable environment for the development of new quality productive forces. The country's unremitting pursuit of new breakthroughs in frontier technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum, as well as its science and technology cooperation with Belt and Road partner countries and regions demonstrate its intention to build an open environment for innovation with global competitiveness, which will nurture new quality productive forces. Seymur Mammadov, director of the international experts' club EurAsia-Azerbaijan, once observed that scientific and technological innovation is the core of China's development, which will enhance its national strength greatly. Chinese modernization is showing a strong momentum. For China, the right way to seek development is through cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, which offers a broader vision. Promoting International Cooperation A close observation of the third plenum of the 20th CPC Central Committee can lead to the conclusion that the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces can create an enabling environment for Chinese modernization, which is expected to create new opportunities for the country's win-win cooperation with the rest of the world. While showing more confidence in high-quality development spurred by the new quality productive forces, China is poised to help create global common prosperity through deepened international cooperation and collaboration. In today\'s new round of technological revolution, the major economies are promoting future-oriented industries for more development steam. The new quality productive forces were born out of technological revolution and industrial transformation. The resolution adopted at the plenum said that China will ""improve the policy and governance systems for promoting the development of strategic industries such as next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aviation and aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine, and quantum technology."" With the high-quality development of China\'s new industrial models attracting global attention, it should strengthen and improve international communication so that the productive forces are well interconnected and integrated globally. Rafia Irfan, a researcher with the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, noted that China has become a frontrunner in a range of technological fields, such as 5G technology, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and space exploration. Chinese companies, who employ talents from all over the world, are providing technical support to the growth of many developing countries. ""Made in China"" products have long earned international recognition. The Democratic Practices and Modernization in China Global Survey 2023 released by the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies, found that the respondents from 23 countries spoke highly of China\'s manufacturing and technological innovations. They consider many Chinese industries, including super rice and crop hybridization, high-speed railway, 5G telecommunication, and infrastructure, to be world leaders. China advocates that the fruits of development should be enjoyed by all. From ""Made in China"" to ""Innovated in China,"" China hopes to contribute more to global common development with its manufacturing prowess. Tackling common development problems is also one of China's goals. Issues such as imbalanced ecological environment, resource shortage, and economic slowdown are common in many countries, despite their different development models. The general trend is to utilize natural resources in a scientific way, develop industries in a coordinated way, and guide quality production factors to flow toward the new quality productive force sectors. The common challenges faced by the world requires the international community to work in unison and forgo any decoupling mentality. With stronger people-to-people exchanges and strategic collaboration, the world can realize common prosperity, opening a new chapter in global modernization featuring peace, development and mutually beneficial cooperation.

67,New railway will turn Central Asia into a major Eurasian hub,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202406\20\WS66737003a31095c51c509d22.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/20/WS66737003a31095c51c509d22.html,"A trilateral intergovernmental agreement on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project was signed at a ceremony in Beijing on June 6. President Xi Jinping, President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev hailed the event as a sign of unity and shared progress. In his address, President Xi underscored the railway project as an epitome of strategic cooperation within the Belt and Road Initiative. The signing of the agreement establishes a robust legal foundation for the project and signifies a major shift from a mere vision to a tangible reality. China's dedication to collaborating with the two Central Asian countries to accelerate the construction of this strategic transport corridor is a clear indication of the collective progress of the project, which is set to bring substantial benefits to all three countries. The governments of China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan agreed to embark on constructing the new railway at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit held in the Uzbek city of Samarkand in September, 2022. The project feasibility study was updated following the completion of field surveys by Chinese engineers in December last year. All three countries have diligently prepared for the construction, which is expected to commence later this year. The new railway, a beacon of hope and optimism, will start in China's Kashgar and traverse Torugart, Kosh-Dobo, and Kazarman in Kyrgyzstan, culminating in Andijan in eastern Uzbekistan. It is estimated that the railway will shorten the route between China and Europe by about 900 kilometers and reduce freight transit time by eight days. This transformative railway, with its potential to enhance trade and economic cooperation between the countries along its path, holds the promise of a brighter future and instills optimism due to the potential economic benefits it will bring. According to an earlier announcement, the planned 523-km railway will be constructed through a joint venture involving three countries. The estimated total cost of the project is $8 billion, with $4.7 billion allocated for the Kyrgyz part. In a testament to the project's significance, Japarov emphasized that this project is crucial for Kyrgyzstan's global connectivity, allowing his landlocked country to connect with the rest of the world. The project was first proposed in the 1990s, and the three sides signed a memorandum of understanding on constructing the railway in 1997. Some experts believe political and geopolitical problems have hindered the project's development. However, we don't share this view. China is a pragmatic partner, and economic feasibility is crucial for making any decision. This time, practical considerations again played a critical role. The launch of this project occurred thanks to the unfolding Eurasian railway revolution, a clear demonstration of which are the facts listed below. On May 25, a significant event occurred: the 90,000th trip was made on the China-Europe freight rail link, mainly through its northern route via Kazakhstan and Russia. Since its inception in 2011, the service has transported over 8.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units containers carrying goods valued at more than $380 billion. This impressive accomplishment highlights the success of that railway link. Currently, China-Europe freight trains connect 223 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries, creating a service network spanning almost the entire Eurasian continent. Between 2016 and 2023, the annual number of China-Europe freight train trips increased from 1,702 to over 17,000. The value of goods transported by this service rose from $8 billion in 2016 to $56.7 billion in 2023.This rapid growth reflects the growing market demand for this efficient and dependable mode of transportation, especially when compared to air and sea routes. The traffic's rapid growth continued this year. From January to April, 6,184 China-Europe freight trains operated, delivering 675,000 TEUs of cargo. It represents a 10 percent increase in the number of trains and an 11 percent increase in cargo compared to the same period of last year. The set-scheduled service has further improved transit time, with a journey from Xi'an to Duisburg, Germany, now taking only 12 days. The rapidly growing rail traffic volume shows that developing an additional rail transport route between China and Europe, this time through Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South Caucasus, will be economically feasible. The construction of this railway line will create the shortest land route between the two economic centers of the Eurasian continent along the Middle Corridor. At the same time, it will establish direct rail connections between China and Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Iran, Turkiye, and Europe, transforming Central Asia from a landlocked to a land-connected area. The new railway lines will intersect in Central Asia with planned and under-construction railway lines in the North-South direction from Russia and Central Asia through Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the deep-water ports of the Indian Ocean. President of Uzbekistan Mirziyoyev specifically highlighted this potential during the signing ceremony on June 6 by saying that the railway will become the shortest land channel between China and the Central Asian countries and open the big markets of the South Asian and Middle Eastern countries. If this plan comes to fruition, the intersection of the East-West and North-South railway routes in Central Asia could transform the region into a major transport hub for the entire Eurasian continent. If this happens, the Great Silk Road revival could become a reality.

68,New technology experimented with to help drivers stay cool in summer,"('Pakistan', 'Lahore', 'Lahore')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\19\WS66c29dc2a31060630b923b48.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/19/WS66c29dc2a31060630b923b48.html,"As more electric vehicles feature panoramic sunroofs, which enhance visibility but can lead to unbearable temperatures during summers, automakers are exploring new materials to help keep interiors cool. Japanese automaker Nissan recently displayed a so-called Cool Paint developed with Chinese company Radi-Cool, a cooling technology provider. The paint can reflect light more effectively and generate electromagnetic waves that block the sun's rays, redirecting heat away from vehicles to keep the interior cooler. Nissan has tested the paint on vehicles operating around Tokyo's Haneda Airport, an ideal location for assessing the technology due to the large open area. According to Nissan, the paint reduced the roof panel temperature by 12 degrees Celsius and lowered the interior temperature by 5 C. The material is six times thicker than standard car paint, measuring 120 microns  a result of testing more than 100 samples to find the optimal formula. The research team aims to make the new paint thinner in the future, focusing on reduced weight and more color options, the automaker said. Susumu Miura, a manager at the Nissan Research Center, said: ""My dream is to create cooler cars without consuming energy,"" adding that this goal is crucial in the era of EVs, where air conditioning usage can significantly reduce a battery\'s range. A study of Recurrent, a United States company, shows that, at 38 C, the range of electric cars could decrease by up to 31 percent, when it tested the performance of 7,500 EVs. Toyota Motor has also been experimenting with paint that lowers cabin temperatures, mostly focusing on colors that refract the sun's rays. Hyundai launched the Nano Cooling Film in April, which is billed as a ""revolutionary vehicle window tint"" that offers better interior cooling than conventional tints. The South Korean automaker tested the Nano Cooling Film on approximately 70 vehicles in Lahore, Pakistan, where summer temperatures can exceed 50 C.Hyundai said that the film's cooling effect is optimized for higher ambient temperatures. During testing, the Nano Cooling Film reduced the temperature near the driver's head by up to 10.9 C compared to conventional tint film. When compared to a vehicle without any window tint, the film lowered the temperature by up to 12.33 C. In addition to the materials under development, car manufacturers have implemented measures to help vehicles cool down during the summers. Xiaomi Auto has used silver-plated glass to enhance sun protection, saying its sedan boasts a 99.5 percent UV blocking rate and a 97.6 percent infrared blocking rate. According to data released by Xiaomi Auto, after being exposed to direct sunlight at 38 C for 90 minutes, the interior temperature of the Xiaomi SU7 reached 59.5 C, 10 degrees lower than other models. The Ford Mustang Mach-E features a front windshield with IRR heat-balance technology coating and a panoramic sunroof with Low-E high-efficiency heat-insulating coating. Engineers have tested materials and components to ensure they can withstand high temperatures and strong sunlight without being deformed or damaged. The glass of the Ford SUV underwent rigorous light exposure tests, including 49 days of laboratory testing and two years of outdoor exposure, to ensure that the adhesive of the glass met high strength standards.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202408/19/66c29dc2a3106063b5942e93.jpeg'],"['Visitors inspect a Ford Mustang Mach-E at an auto show in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in 2023.

The terrorists attacked a convoy of vehicles from the Port Qasim Electric Power Company near Jinnah International Airport in Karachi around 11:00 pm on Sunday. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army issued a statement through social media, claiming responsibility for the attack, but the Pakistani authorities have not confirmed it. This is the second time in seven months that Chinese nationals have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. On March 26, five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in a suicide terror attack at the China-invested Dasu hydropower project in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Although the Pakistani authorities announced in May that they had arrested 11 Islamist militants said to have been involved in the suicide bombing in March, the Sunday attack should prompt them to do more to improve the security situation in the country. The latest attack happened less than five months after Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar's visit to Beijing during which the Pakistani side pledged to hunt down the perpetrators of the March attack and bring them to justice, and better protect Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in Pakistan. But Pakistan's counterterrorism measures have not been able to prevent terrorist attacks, with terrorist outfits continuing to threaten the projects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The CPEC projects are of strategic significance and will help Pakistan boost its economic growth, improve Pakistani people's livelihoods and promote green development. As such, China and Pakistan should further strengthen counterterrorism and security cooperation. Schadenfreude is what anti-China forces feel when terrorists attack CPEC projects in Pakistan.

Through the vivid narration of the people in the stories, readers can get a better understanding of a country that is boosting openness. Hafiz Mamoon Rehman, born in a small village in Pakistan's Punjab Province, grew up surrounded by golden wheat and cotton as white as snow. Unlike the generations before him who worked the land, he chased academic excellence and sought knowledge beyond the familiar terrain of his homeland. Rehman made a journey into the fields of biotechnology, where he grappled with the intricacies of herbicide resistance and genetically modified wheat. In 2016, while pursuing his doctorate at Chonnam National University in South Korea, he chose soybeans as the subject of his long-term research. Later, he sent resumes to soybean experts across the globe. It was a message from Lam Honming, a professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong's School of Life Sciences, that set the stage for what was to come. Lam, a prominent expert in agricultural science, had decoded the genomes of 31 soybean varieties, bred non-genetically modified drought and salinity-tolerant germplasms, and was the first from Hong Kong to participate in a national-level space agricultural research project. Two years later, Rehman joined Lam's lab, completing a successful three-year postdoctoral stint. Hong Kong became a dream for him, a place where he built a family and created memories, including the birth of his child at Prince of Wales Hospital. Yet, despite the allure of the vibrant city, Rehman never lost sight of his goal  returning home and using his knowledge to help his people. After years of learning, Rehman is now at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, developing local soybean varieties suited for the conditions in Pakistan. Pakistan, primarily an agrarian nation, faces challenges due to limited crop diversity and the adverse effects of climate change. With most of its agricultural land dedicated to five traditional crops and suffering from low soybean yield and quality, the country relies heavily on soybean imports for animal feed. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres once said that Pakistan is one of the countries most severely affected by climate change, a fact not lost on Rehman as he sought to introduce soybeans as a sustainable crop in his homeland. Sowing hope Iqrar Ahmad Khan, vice-chancellor of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, explained that Pakistan spent up to $2 billion annually importing about 300,000 metric tons of soybeans. ""What\'s important now is to bring in soybean as a mainstream green crop,"" he said. Achieving this goal meant finding the right seeds, and that is where Lam's expertise came into the picture. He had already cultivated the Longhuang series soybean in China's Gansu province, which is known for its high yield and quality even in arid and saline conditions. In 2023, Lam, for the first time, visited Pakistan, taking with him a branch of seeds. Unlike the Longhuang series, what Lam prepared for Pakistan is genetically unstable soybean seeds, still undergoing change, with the hope of developing a variety that could thrive in the local environment. Early this May, Lam led a team, including agricultural scientists, engineers and seed experts from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, alongside a group of Pakistani students from two Hong Kong middle schools, that arrived in Lahore, Punjab, to make a straightforward agricultural exchange. Lam said he hoped these students could observe their homeland from a different perspective and understand the connection between Hong Kong and Pakistan. Punjab, Pakistan's breadbasket, is a province with more than 100 million people and the most developed agricultural sector in the country. ""Introducing soybeans to Punjab is not an easy task,"" said Rehman, who noted the crop\'s novelty to local farmers. Zhang Guohong, a retired seasoned expert from the Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, bridged language barriers through his extensive agricultural knowledge, communicating with local farmers about irrigation, fertilization and cultivation techniques. The high temperatures of Punjab, edging close to 50 C, posed a significant challenge. ""The extremely hot weather almost melted everything,"" Zhang said. The resilient seeds provided by Lam sprouted, offering a glimmer of hope. ""It\'s only by starting from a seed and struggling together that they can develop new varieties that truly belong there,"" said Lam. China, with only 9 percent of the world's arable land and 6 percent of its freshwater resources, has sustained nearly one-fifth of the global population. Lam, 64, said China's experiences in rural vitalization over the past decade or so have provided valuable lessons for other developing countries. Official data show that China has dispatched more than 2,000 agricultural experts and technicians to more than 70 countries and regions worldwide. At the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Iqrar Ahmad Khan said the institution has signed more than 50 cooperation agreements with numerous Chinese universities and research institutions. Rehman also has strong ties with China. He showed the shirt he was wearing, saying it was a commemorative T-shirt given to him during a previous agricultural inspection in Hainan province, and had a Chinese logo printed on it. And this time, the seeds from Hong Kong, China, did not disappoint him. Approximately 3.5 hectares have been planted with soybeans that are anticipated to produce an impressive yield of 2,500 kilograms per hectare come summer. Additionally, Rehman witnessed a breakthrough three months into planting, with the soybeans segregating positively toward a locally adapted variety. The collaboration between China and Pakistan in agricultural development highlighted the enduring bonds between the two nations, he said. ""Building international friendships, connecting people at the grassroots level, and using science to help those in need have always been the core values of our Hong Kong team.""",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/14/67355afba310f1268d84cf88.jpeg'],['Hafiz Mamoon Rehman gives a thumbs-up in the soybean field.\xa0XUE JINGQI/CHINA DAILY'],2024-11-14 10:05,XUE JINGQI in Hong Kong,"- **Main Topics:**

As a child, Qadir had two dreams: to either become a pilot or an actor. In 2014, following his father's advice, the then-21-year-old enrolled in a course at Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an. It was there that Qadir developed a deeper knowledge of the history of Sino-Pakistani friendship and China's successful economic development in the past few decades. The Belt and Road Initiative, which was proposed in 2013, only strengthened his determination to stay. Xi\'an impressed him with its ancient history, mouthwatering delicacies and hospitality. He has visited the Terracotta Warriors three times, and his younger brother and sister are also in China. ""Now I am familiar with the city and do not need to use navigation apps most of the time,"" he said with pride. His acting career also began during his university days, when he used to work as a part-time model. For Qadir, films are a window into unfamiliar countries and also help build bridges between different cultures. ""Before I came to China, I enjoyed watching Chinese action comedy movies like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, and held the misconception that every Chinese knew kung fu,"" he said, smiling. ""After traveling to Beijing, Shenzhen and other cities and acting in different roles, I had the opportunity to experience different aspects of traditional Chinese culture, including calligraphy, and see the real China for myself,"" he added. Qadir has so far starred in three movies and features in several upcoming TV dramas. ""From walk-on parts to leading roles, I want to show the audience the real China and show the sincere friendship between China and Pakistan,"" he said. In 2019, Qadir founded a media company in Xi'an specializing in the production of movies, short videos and livestream shows.

76,Philippines' opportunism doomed to failure,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\11\WS6708623fa310f1265a1c6f78.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/11/WS6708623fa310f1265a1c6f78.html,"The Philippines has been making provocative moves in the South China Sea and thus escalating tensions in the region since last year. Perhaps Philippine leaders have not heard of a Chinese saying: A quarrel between two sides will only benefit a third party. The Philippines hopes to benefit from the United States' moves to check China's rise and maintain its hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region. For decades, the Philippines has been an opportunistic player. In 1971, taking advantage of rotating its troops to deal with a typhoon, the Philippines illegally occupied Zhongye Island in the South China Sea. In 1999, when the bombing of the Chinese embassy in erstwhile Yugoslavia heightened tensions between China and the US, it grounded a World War II-era warship on Ren'ai Reef in a bid to occupy it permanently. Also, for decades, it has been trying to benefit from the US-China competition, especially from deteriorating US-China relations. However, in its blind pursuit of material and strategic benefits, the Philippines has become a pawn in the hands of the US, which has been furthering its ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" to contain China. The Philippines' opportunistic trait aligns perfectly well with the US' China-containment strategy. What Manila doesn't understand is that it can use the Philippines-US Mutual Defense Treaty to extort military aid from Washington, but not draw the US into a confrontation with China. History tells us that the US has often left its allies in the lurch because it has always believed in serving its own interests. For example, in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 during the Vietnam War, the US publicly refused France's request for assistance. In the same year, the US signed a so-called mutual defense treaty with China's Taiwan but did not get directly involved when the Chinese People's Liberation Army shelled Kinmen in 1958, aside from providing some logistical support to the island. Besides, the US pulled Pakistan into a bilateral mutual defense assistance agreement and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with seven other countries, again in 1954. However, during the 1965 India-Pakistan War, it turned down Pakistan's request for assistance, stating that the agreement did not apply to the conflict. A recent Congressional Research Service report on ""US-China Strategic Competition in South and East China Seas ""said the US is wary of the Philippines taking extreme actions under the treaty that may drag the US into a military conflict with China, and suggested that Congress review the treaty\'s applicability. Buyers are rarely smarter than sellers in business. Dealing with the US is akin to selling the soul to the devil. The US, as the dealer at a gambling table, can see every card the Philippines is holding and knows how to manipulate the latter's moves. Moreover, the US' interpretation of the Philippines-US Mutual Defense Treaty is flexible, because it uses a strategy of ambiguity to mislead the Philippines in different international political circumstances. In 1975, then US secretary of state Henry Kissinger issued a memorandum, legally interpreting the commitments of the US under the Philippines-US Mutual Defense Treaty, saying that US commitments in the ""MDT may apply in event of attack on (Philippine) forces deployed to third countries"". The report cited two reasons for that: first, the Nansha Islands are not part of Philippine territory; and second, the Philippines is not a claimant in respect of the Nansha Islands. The US always accords the highest priority to its interests, which the Philippines may be aware of. But being an opportunistic player, the Philippines still believes it can gain from its alliance with the US without realizing that it is being led down the garden path by the US. The Philippines will be in great danger if it believes US soldiers will shed blood for Philippine ships or personnel in the South China Sea.

Xue Jingqi reports. Hafiz Mamoon Rehman, born in a small village in Pakistan's Punjab province, grew up surrounded by golden wheat and cotton as white as snow. Unlike the generations before him who toiled the land, he chased academic excellence and sought knowledge beyond the familiar terrain of his homeland. ""Agriculture is food for poor countries,"" he says. Rehman's journey led him to the fields of biotechnology, where he grappled with the intricacies of herbicide resistance and genetically modified wheat. In 2016, while pursuing his doctorate at Chonnam National University in South Korea, he chose soybeans as the subject of his long-term research. He cast his resume into the world, reaching out to soybean experts across the globe. It was a message from Professor Lam Hon-ming of The Chinese University of Hong Kong's School of Life Sciences that set the stage for what was to come.

Hong Kong became a dream for him, a place where he built up a family and memories, including the birth of his child at Prince of Wales Hospital. Yet, despite the allure of the vibrant city, Rehman never lost sight of his goal – returning home and using his knowledge to help his people. ""Hong Kong has a better life. But, I think if you really want to serve the farmer community, you should come to some agricultural country and serve."" Sowing Hope After years of growth and learning, Rehman became a beacon of hope at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, developing local soybean varieties suited for the conditions in Pakistan. Pakistan, primarily an agrarian nation, faces challenges due to limited crop diversity and the adverse effects of climate change. With most of its agricultural land dedicated to five traditional crops and suffering from low soybean yield and quality, the country relies heavily on soybean imports for animal feed, unlike China's familiarity and consumption of soy products. United Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres labeled Pakistan as one of the countries most severely affected by climate change, a fact not lost on Rehman as he sought to introduce soybeans as a sustainable crop in his homeland. Professor Iqrar Ahmad Khan  vice-chancellor of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad  explains that Pakistan spends up to two billion dollars annually importing around three 300,000 tons of soybeans. ""What\'s important now is to bring in soybean as a mainstream green crop."" Achieving this goal meant finding the right seeds, and that's where Lam's expertise came into the picture. He had already cultivated the Longhuang series soybean in China's Gansu province, which is known for its high yield and quality even in arid and saline conditions. In 2023, Lam, for the first time, visited Pakistan, taking with him a branch of seeds. Unlike the Long Huang series, what Lam prepared for Pakistan is genetically unstable soybean seeds, still undergoing change, with the hope of developing a variety that could thrive in the local environment. In March this year, the news of a terror attack targeting a Chinese construction project in Pakistan's Cape province sent shockwaves across the globe. The incident raised serious concerns for Lam and his team's upcoming visit. Departure and Arrival Although the attack loomed large over the trip, members of Lam's team, including agricultural scientists, engineers and seed experts from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, alongside a group of Pakistani students from two Hong Kong middle schools, were not deterred, converging on Hong Kong International Airport in early May. Lam said he hopes these students could observe their homeland from a different perspective and understand the connection between Hong Kong and Pakistan. After a 10-hour flight and a layover, Lam and his team touched down in Lahore amid tight security. The trip, meant to be a straightforward agricultural exchange, now required navigating a complex security landscape. Punjab, Pakistan's breadbasket, was the destination  a province with more than 100 million people and the most developed agricultural sector in the country. ""Introducing soybeans to Punjab is not an easy task,"" says Rehman, noting the crop\'s novelty to local farmers. In the following days, Rehman and Lam\'s team visited various villages, encountering soybean plots tucked away among cornfields, coriander, and winter melons, or nestled within vast sunflower expanses. Zhang Guohong, a retired seasoned expert from Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, bridged language barriers through his extensive agricultural knowledge, communicating with local farmers about irrigation, fertilization, and cultivation techniques. The high temperatures of Punjab, edging close to 50 degrees Celsius, posed a significant challenge. ""The extremely hot weather almost melted everything,"" Zhang says. And, the resilient seeds provided by Lam sprouted, offering a glimmer of hope. ""I used to give them seeds that were already stable. This year, I brought new seeds that are still changing. It\'s only by starting from a seed and struggling together that they can develop new varieties that truly belong there"", says Lam. As the Chinese saying goes  give people fish and you feed them for a day. Teach them how to fish and you feed them for a lifetime. Lam shared this Chinese philosophy through actions. Backbone of Life China, with only 9 percent of the world's arable land and 6 percent of its freshwater resources, has sustained nearly one-fifth of the global population. Over the past 75 years, the average disposable income of rural residents has soared from mere single digits to impressive five-digit figures, and nearly 100 million rural inhabitants have lifted themselves out of poverty, achieving the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development's poverty reduction targets a decade ahead of schedule. Lam, as a 64-year-old agricultural scientist, has witnessed and contributed to the country's reforms and development in rural areas, saying China's experiences in rural revitalization in the past decade or so have provided valuable lessons for other developing countries. Official data shows that China has dispatched over 2,000 agricultural experts and technicians to more than 70 countries and regions worldwide. These professionals have promoted over 1,500 agricultural techniques, advancing rural poverty alleviation, modern agricultural development, and increased income for farmers in Asia, Africa, the South Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. At the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Professor Iqrar Ahmad Khan points out that the institution has signed over 50 cooperation agreements with numerous Chinese universities and research institutions. By the end of last year, there were approximately 28,000 Pakistani students in China, forming one of the largest groups of foreign students in the country. Rehman, of course, had strong ties with China as well. He showed the shirt he was wearing, saying it was a commemorative T-shirt given to him during a previous agricultural inspection in Hainan province, and had a Chinese logo printed on it. And this time, the seeds from Hong Kong, China, did not disappoint him. Approximately 3.5 hectares have been planted with soybeans that are anticipated to produce an impressive yield of 2,500 kilograms per hectare come summer. Additionally, Rehman witnessed a breakthrough three months into planting, with the soybeans segregating positively towards a locally adapted variety. Lam's visit was more than an exchange of seeds. It was a transfer of knowledge and a gesture of friendship. The collaboration between China and Pakistan in agricultural development highlighted the enduring bonds between the two nations, tracing back to the ancient Silk Road and flourishing under the modern Belt and Road Initiative. ""Building international friendships, connecting people at the grassroots level, and using science to help those in need have always been the core values of our Hong Kong team,"" says Lam. He emphasized the significance of sharing goodwill and friendship, especially as the country is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its founding this year. Agriculture, at its core, is about nurturing life and sustaining communities. It's the embodiment of tireless work and the pursuit of innovations that can weather the storms of a changing world. For Lam and his team, it's about sharing the fruits of their labor, not just in China, but across the globe. Their work continues beyond Pakistan, from developing drought-tolerant soybeans in South Africa to studying space-bred Longhuang seeds that traveled with the Shenzhou spacecraft. The soybean journey is just the beginning and, with it, the narrative of a burgeoning world of sustainable agriculture unfolds, a story that Lam and Rehman continue to write with each seed they plant. ""My kids are also living in the village, just like me. So, they would know how farmers grow food and how to help others,"" says Rehman.",['http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d7cf9a310f1268d85eb7f.png'],['Hafiz Mamoon Rehman gives a thumbs-up in the soybean field.

I've wandered through bustling city streets, alive with commerce and energy, and strolled through tranquil villages where life moves to the beat of nature's drum. But it's here, in the quiet expanse of the countryside, that I've found the heart of my story. Each morning, as the first light of dawn creeps across the land, the farmers begin their daily toil. They work until the evening shadows claim the fields, their labor a testament to the cycle of life and sustenance. Witnessing their unwavering commitment, I am touched by the simple, yet profound, act of planting a seed — a symbol of hope and faith in the future. Hong Kong may lie far beyond the horizon, but it's never felt closer than it does here, amid the soybeans and the soil. The efforts of scientists from both Pakistan and Hong Kong — collaborating on innovative agricultural techniques and sharing knowledge — have shrunk the distance between us. Through their work, they are sowing their own kind of seeds, which promise to yield a harvest of understanding and cooperation that transcends borders. It's a narrative that reminds us that, no matter how far apart we may seem, the fruits of collaboration and common purpose can bring us together, creating a world that is, in essence, a smaller place for us all.",[],[],2024-12-02 17:29,Xue Jingqi,"**Main Topics:**

80,Reality Check: Falsehoods in US perceptions of China,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202206\19\WS62af0b22a310fd2b29e63867.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202206/19/WS62af0b22a310fd2b29e63867.html,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has recently delivered a speech at Asia Society outlining the US administration\'s approach to China. With carefully calibrated language, he sought to promote the ""China threat"" narrative, interfere in China\'s internal affairs, and smear China\'s domestic and foreign policy, all in an attempt at full-blown containment and suppression of China. In what is to follow, we will use facts and figures toshow to the world how deceptive, hypocritical and dangerous the US's China policy is. Falsehood 1: China poses the most serious long-term challenge to the international order and is undermining it. The US will defend the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, and protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations. RealityCheck: Whatthe US has constantly vowed to preserve is a so-called international order designed to serve the US'sown interests and perpetuate itshegemony. The US itself is the largest source of disruption to the actual world order. China has been and always will be a defender of the international order. China is a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter. China is committed to upholding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations built on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly championed by China, India and Myanmar have been widely recognized by the international community and have become the basic norms guiding state-to-state relations. China upholds true multilateralism and global strategic stability. China is the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN Security Council and the second largest contributor among all countries to the UN peacekeeping budget. China has taken an active part in international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferationprocesses. It has signed or acceded to more than 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). China is againstarms race. In the wake of the international financial crisis of 2008, China adopted a responsible macro policy, remained a ""stabilizer"" for the world economy and made important contribution to global recovery. China actively provides international public goods to various countries, and has signed BRI cooperation agreements with 149 countries and 32 international organizations. In recent years, President Xi Jinping's vision of building a community with a shared futurefor mankind has been warmly received by the international community. It has been written into multiple important documents issued by the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other multilateral institutions. UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres hailed China as an important pillar for multilateralism, noting that the purpose for practicing multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Peter Thomson, president of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly,said the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind advocated by China is the only future for humanity on this planet. In response tovarious new global challenges, President Xi Jinping put forwardthe Global Development Initiative(GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). They represent China's proposals for making the global governance system fairer and more equitable, and have received positive response and wide supportfrom the international community. The US has blatantly violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the norms governing international relations. Withits military might, the US has launched wars in numerous parts of the world, stoking divisions and conflicts and bringing huge turmoil and disaster to the world. Throughout the240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years in which the US was not at war. The US might as well be called the most belligerent country in the history of the world. US magazine The National Interestquoted Dakota Wood, senior research fellow for defense programs at the Heritage Foundation, who wrote that the US consistently needed to deploy military force every 15 years or so. Since the end of World War II, the United States has either launched or participated in many wars overseas, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Afghan War and the Iraq War. Those wars caused extremely severe civilian casualties and property losses, and lead to colossal humanitarian disasters. Since 2001, US wars and military operations in the name of counterterrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, about 335,000 of whom were civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions. The US habitually puts its domestic law above the international law, and selectively applies international rules as it sees fit. Sincethe 1980s, the US had once withdrawnfrom17 international organizations and treaties,includingthe United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),the Paris Agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT),the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)Treaty and the Treaty on Open Skies. Although the current US administration declared that ""America is back"" and the US has rejoined some international organizations and agreements, the administration has in essence not abandoned the ""America First"" policy, and is advancing ""selective multilateralism"".The current administration has stayed out of institutions and agreements considered harmful to US interests such as the Treaty on Open Skies. European media have described it as ""America First 2.0"". The UShas abusedits financial hegemony andtechnological clout and engaged in economic coercion in the name of protecting national security. The US has enacted some domestic laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and the Countering America\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, andissued aseries of executive ordersto target and sanction specific countries, entitiesor individuals. Theambiguous rulescontained in these acts and executive orders,such as the ""minimum contacts principle"" and ""doctrine of effects"",are a willfulexpansion ofthe jurisdiction ofUSdomestic laws.The US also abuses itsdomesticchannels of prosecutionto exercise long-arm jurisdiction over entities and individuals in other countries. For more than 60 years, intotal disregard of the many resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the US hascontinueditscomprehensive blockade against Cuba based on its embargo policies and domestic laws such as theTorricelli Actand theHelms-Burton Act. The Cuba blockade is the longest and cruelestsystemic trade embargo, economic blockadeand financial sanctions in modern history. The blockade has been gravely detrimentalto Cuba's economic and social development, causing over 100 billion USdollars ofdirect losses to Cuba's economy. The US has carried out blockade and sanctions against Iran sincelate 1970s. In May 2018, the US government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, and soon after resumed and expandedsanctions against Iran. Many countries and relevant entities have beenforced to give up their cooperation with Iran. A large number of foreign oil enterprises left the country. Iran'smanufacturing industry can hardly sustain normal operation. The country has sufferedeconomic slowdown, coupled with heightened inflationand massive currency depreciation. TheUShasimposed unilateral sanctions onBelarus,SyriaandZimbabwe,amongothers, over the years, and ratcheted up""maximum pressure"" againstthe DPRK,Venezuela, etc. Statistics show that the previous US administration had imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which meansitwielded its ""big stick"" three times a dayon average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individualson USsanction liststopped9,421,which was 933percenthigher comparedto the fiscal year 2000. The US'sillegalunilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have gravely undermined the sovereignty and security of other countries and severely impactedtheir economic development and people's wellbeing. The sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction alsoconstitute a gross violation ofinternational law and basic norms of international relations. In an article published in the September/October 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Daniel Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, criticizessuccessive US administrations for using ""sanctions as the go-to solution for nearly every foreign policy problem."" He notes that sanctionsnot only are ineffective, but also ""exert a humanitarian toll"", and thatthe United States of America has become the ""United States of Sanctions"". The ""rules-based international order"" championed by the US is in fact another version of power politics. This is an attempt to impose one\'s own will and standards on others, and to replace the commonly accepted international laws and norms with the house rules of a few countries. In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Before wanting to discuss rules and order, the US should first pay up its arrearsofonebillionUS dollarsfor the UN's regular budget and 1.4 billionUS dollarspeacekeeping assessments, ratify in a timely mannerthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, stop single-handedly blocking the negotiations on a verification protocol under the Biological Weapons Convention(BWC),lift illegal unilateral sanctions, earnestly fulfill its international obligations and set a good example for others in respecting laws and norms. Falsehood 2: The USis not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. It doesn't seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China from growing itseconomy or advancing the interests of itspeople. Reality Check:Despite its claims that it doesn't seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop itfrom growing itseconomy, the US is actually deploying its domestic and external resources to unscrupulouslycontain and suppress China. Without producing any credible evidence, the US government uses national security as a catch-all pretext and all its apparatus to wantonly suppress and sanction Huawei, restricting its products' entry into the US market, cutting off its access to chips and operating system, and coercing countries around the world into banning Huawei from their 5G rollout. The US also orchestrated and pressured Canada to hold Huawei's CFO for nearly three years without cause. In violation of the principle of fair competition and market economy and international trading rules, the USseeks to hamstring competitive Chinese hi-tech companies under all kinds of trumped-up charges.To date, it has placed over 1,000 Chinese companies on various sanctions lists, subjected biotechnology and artificial intelligence technologies to enhanced export controls and stringent investment review, and sought to ban Chinese social media platforms including TikTok and WeChat. Under the pretext of protecting human rights, the US has fabricated misinformation and disinformation concerning Xinjiang such as the existence of""forced labor"" and, on the basis of those unfounded stories, has adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act which maliciously targets Xinjiang\'s competitive cotton, tomatoesand solar photovoltaic sectors to contain China\'s growth. This has disrupted the international trade order and destabilized global industrial and supply chains. The previous US administration, in grave violation of WTO rules, waged a massive trade war on China. Basedon its own Section 301 investigation, it imposed three rounds of steep tariffs on about 360 billion US dollars' worth of Chinese imports. In September 2021, the current US administration initiated aSection 232 investigationto determine the effects on US national security from imports of neodymium-iron-boronpermanent magnetsat a time when global commodity prices were hovering at elevated levels. The US has a record of grossly interfering in China's domestic affairs on issues concerning China's core interests, including Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. It seeks to undermine China's security and stability by, both overtly and covertly, condoning and supporting separatist activities. The bipartisan innovation bills being debated in the US Congress, while professing to enhance US competitiveness, see China as a perceived rival. ""China"" appears more than 800 times in the text, which is packed with provisions detrimental to China\'s interests. In a bid to maintain its power and predominance in international institutions, the US has attempted to smear and block the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the initiative of advancing Belt and Road cooperation, among others, in multilateral fora and also to remove references to them in UN and other international documents. Clinging to a Cold War mentality and the hegemon\'s logic, the US pursues bloc politics, concocts the ""democracy versus authoritarianism"" narrative, cajoles other countries into forming exclusive cliques, strengthensthe Five Eyes, peddles the Quad mechanism, puts together AUKUS with the UK and Australia and ramps up bilateral military alliances, in a clear attempt atcountering China. TheUS pushes NATO to insert itself in Asia-Pacific affairs, fan the ""China threat"" narrative in the bloc\'s new strategic concept, and include in its Madrid Summit such US allies in the Asia-Pacific as Japan, the Republic of Korea(ROK) and Australia, in a bid to build an ""Asia-Pacific version of NATO"", which would disrupt security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The development of state-to-state relations should be based on equality, mutual respect and win-win results. China-US relations have reached an important crossroads. The US should stop viewing this relationship through a Cold War, zero-sum mindset, follow the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and reflect in its action the five assurances it has made to China (i.e. the US does not seek a new Cold War with China, the US does not seek to change China\'s system, the revitalization of US alliances is not against China, the US does not support ""Taiwan independence"", and the US is not looking for conflict with China) . Falsehood 3: Our diplomacy is based on partnership and respect for each other's interests, while China practices coercive diplomacy against other countries and retaliates recklessly. Our task is to prove once again that all countries will be free to chart their own paths without coercion. Reality Check: It is the US that invented ""coercive diplomacy"" and excels at coercing countries. Over the years, by imposing economic blockade, unilateral sanctions and other means, the US has practiced coercive diplomacy around the world with textbook examples. In 1971, American scholar Alexander George first put forward the concept of ""coercive diplomacy"" to summarize the US policy toward Laos, Cuba and Vietnam at that time. The US government forced the military government of Haiti to step down in 1994, and referred to that as ""a textbook example of coercive diplomacy"". In 2003, it explicitly characterized 30.3 billion US dollars additional military expenses for ""coercive diplomacy"" as incurred expenses. The US government froze sevenbillion US dollars assets of the Afghan central bank on the grounds of punishing the Afghan Taliban and even claimed the ""life-saving money"" of the Afghan people as its own, which resulted in the deterioration of thehumanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Mohammad Naeem, spokesman of the Taliban Political Office in Doha, said the seizure is ""indicative of the lowest level of human and moral decay of a country and a nation"". In order to force the Nepalese parliament to approve the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement, the US openly issued an ""ultimatum"", saying that the US will review its ties with Nepal if it failsto ratify the compact. After the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, the US Justice Department established the ""Task Force KleptoCapture"" to find, freeze and seize the yachts, apartments, private jets and huge deposits of Russiancitizensin the US and Europe. This fully shows that the US-touted ""inviolable and sacred right to property"" is just a lie. The US has forced other countries to pick sides and pressured them to join sanctions against Russia. And those who refuse to do so will pay a ""price"". After China and the Solomon Islands had signed a framework agreement on bilateral security cooperation, the US sent senior officials of the National Security Council to the country, doing whatever it can to obstruct the legitimate cooperation between China and Solomon Islands. A Solomn Star article pointed out, ""Washington DC, which has literally forgotten Solomon Islands since World War II, has finally woken up and is applying the heat on the Solomon Islands to abandon the security pact."" In May 2022, on the eve of the High-Level Virtual Meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI, the US exerted pressure on multiple UN development agencies to obstruct their attendance and threatened to ""cut funding"".  The ""Clean Network"" program launched by the previous administration is another textbook example of US coercive diplomacy. Under the pretext of upholding US national security and citizens\' privacy, the program explicitly requires that Chinese companies such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba to be purged from five areas: telecom operators, mobile app stores, mobile apps, cloud services and submarine optical cables. The then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other US politicians lobbied all around the world, coercing countries and regions to join its so-called ""Network"". AUS senior officialeven threatened Cyprus and other countries not to work with Chinese 5G suppliers, or they would bear the consequence. Former UK Business and Industry Minister Vince Cable said the government\'s decision to ban Huawei\'s 5G equipment and services ""had nothing to do with national security"", and was because ""the Americans told us we should do it"". The US shows no mercy in coercing its allies. Out of its geopolitical and energy interestsconsiderations, the US has imposed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project since December 2019. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has imposed new sanctions on related companies and personnel even though Germany had announced the suspension of the certification process for the project. AUSscholar pointed out that American foreign policy since World War II has been based on a simple idea: ""Either you are with us or against us. America should lead, allies should follow, and woe be to countries that oppose its primacy"". His words lay bare the nature of US coercive diplomacy. China never engages in coercive diplomacy and firmly opposes coercive diplomacy by other countries. China never threatens other countries with force, never creates military alliance, never exports ideology, never meddles in others' domestic affairs, never seeks a trade war, and never imposes unjustified oppression on foreign enterprises. That said, however, China has the right to make necessary and legitimate responses to actions that undermine China's sovereignty, security and development rights and interests. Falsehood 4:The US democracy is one of the most powerful assets in this contest. Our task is to prove once again that democracy can meet urgent challenges and that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom. Reality Check: The US sets standards for democracy after its own system, does not allow other systems, pathsand models to exist, and gangs up with others to wantonly interfere in other countries'internal affairs in the name of democracy. This not just contravenes the spirit of democracy, but also spells disaster for democracy. The American-style democracy is a rich men\'s game based on capital. Money politics penetrates the entire process of election, legislation and administrationin the US. People in fact only have a restricted right to political participation. The inequality in economic status has turned into inequality in political status. According to statistics, winners of 91 percent of US congressional elections are the candidates with greater financial support. Big companies, a small group of rich people, and interest groups are more generous to offer financial support and have become the main source of electoral funding. The so-called representatives of people\'s will, once elected, often serve the interests of their financial backers, and speak for vested interests rather than the ordinary people. A US Senator had a sharp observation, ""Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress."" US Republican congressman from Alabama Mo Brooks publicly denounced""corruption"" ofthe US Congressin a video on social media. ""If youwant to be chairman of a major committee, you have to purchase it."" The purchase price depends on how important the committee is, withthe minimum bid for a major committee beingone million US dollars. Those whocannot afford ithave to accept the contributions of special interest groups and thengive""quid pro quos"" tothe lobbyists. ""Special interest groups run Washington. I don\'t mean that metaphorically, I mean that literally."" According to ascholar inSingapore,the United States isclearlynot functioning as a democracy. It is functioning as a plutocracy. A democracy is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. A plutocracy is a government of the one percent, by the one percent, for the one percent. The US presidential election follows the Electoral College system, where the president and vice president are elected by the Electoral College. The flaws of such an electoral system are self-evident. First, as the president-elect may not be the winner of the national popular vote, there is a lack of broad representation. Second, as each state gets to decide its own electoral rules, confusion and disorderoften occur. Third, the winner-takes-all system exacerbates inequality among states and between political parties. It leads to a huge waste of votes and discourages voter turnout. Voters in deep blue and deep red states are often neglected, while swing states become disproportionately more important where both parties seek to woo more supporters. There have been five presidential elections in US history in which the winner of nationwide popular vote was not elected the president. The gerrymandering is widely recognized by the US public as a flaw of the electoral system. Itrefers to an unfair division ofelectoral districtsin favor ofa particularparty to win as many seats as possible and cement its advantage.The US conducts a census every ten years. Following the completion of the census, redistricting or the redrawing of electoral district boundaries will take place under the principle of maintaining roughly equal population in every voting district while considering demographic shifts. Under the US Constitution, each state legislature has the power to redistrict. This leaves room for gerrymandering by the majority party in a state legislature. According to a YouGov poll in 2021, only16 percent of US adult citizens say they think their states'congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44 percent say they think the maps would be drawn unfairly and another 40 percent of adults say they are unsure if the maps will be fair. The American-style democracy is""one person one vote""in name, yet ""rule of a dominant minority""in reality. Political pluralism is only a facade. A small number of elites dominate the political, economic and military affairs. They control the state apparatus and policy-making process, manipulate public opinion, dominate the business community and enjoy all kinds of privileges. According to the Associated Press,18.8 million people were missedin the 2020 US census. The black population had a net undercount of 3.3 percent, while it was almost five percent for Hispanics and 5.6 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans living on reservations. The undercount robs them of their equal share of federal resources including in education, health care and housing and puts them in an unfavorable condition as to congressional apportionment. It reveals the hypocrisy in the US democracy and its ""perpetuating systemic racism"". Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the USis a ""really existing capitalist democracy"", where there is a positive correlation between people\'s wealth and their influence on policy-making. For the lower 70percenton the wealth/income scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever. They are effectively disenfranchised. Wertheimer, President of thenon-profit US organization Democracy 21, says thatcorruptioninthe US is systemic corruption of the process itself. ""When you are dealing with billions and billions of dollars, much of that focused on buying influence, it overwhelms the system, and it is much harder to defend against and maintain representation for ordinary Americans."" Danny Haiphong, an independent journalist in the US,believes that Western-style democracy views the election itself as the highest achievement. The question of whether this system serves the needs of the broad masses of people is generally ignored in order to obscure the fact that powerful corporate interests set the policy agenda well before votes are cast. The checks and balances in the American-style democracyhave resulted in a ""vetocracy"". American political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out in his bookPolitical Order and Political Decaythat there is an entrenched political paralysis in the US. The US political system has far too many checks and balances, raising the cost of collective action and in some cases making it impossible altogether. The US democratic process is fragmented and lengthy, with a lot of veto points where individual veto players can block action by the whole body. The function of ""checks and balances"", which was purportedly designed to prevent abuse of power, has been distorted in American political practice. Politicians in Washington, D.C. are preoccupied with securing their own partisan interests and no longercare about national development. The two parties are addicted to vetoing and caught in a vicious circle. The government efficacy is inevitably weakened, law and justice trampled upon, development and progress stalled, and social division widened. According to a Pew Research Center report in October 2021 based on a survey of 17 advanced economies including the US, Germany and theROK, the US is more politically divided than the other economies surveyed. Nine in ten US respondents believe there are strong conflicts between people who support different political parties, and nearly 60 percent of Americans surveyed think their fellow citizens no longer disagree simply over policies, but also over basic facts. Aspolitical and partisan polarization continues to grow, more ""opposition for opposition\'s sake"" is seen among Democrats and Republicans. Under its influence, voters of the two parties are increasingly antagonizedover gun policy. Among Republican voters, 76 percent support the right to possess guns, while 81 percent of Democratic voters seegun control as more important. Hijacked by interest, partisan conflict and the public opinion, the legislation and law enforcement process of gun control is fraught with difficulties. For the past ten years, Democratic congressmen put forward dozens of bills on gun violence and gun control every year, but due to the continued obstruction from the Republican Party, only a handful of them successfully entered the plenary deliberation and debate stage atthe Senate or the House of Representatives. The US National Rifle Association (NRA) has five million members and spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and lobbying every year. Its tentacles penetrate deep into the fabric of the American society. The NRA is an important funder of the Republican Party. Since its establishment in 1871, the NRA has successfully attracted nineUS presidents to join it.According to CNN statistics in 2018, 307 of the 535 US congressmen have received either direct campaign contributions from the NRA and its affiliates or benefited from independent NRA spending like advertising supporting their campaigns. In the face of huge profits, all kinds of gun control efforts have endedup in vain. The US is not a straight A student when it comes todemocracy.Its practice of democracyhas been messy and chaotic. On 6 January 2021, thousands of Americans gathered on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. and stormed the Capitol building in a bid to stop the joint session of the Congress from certifying the newly-elected president. The incident interrupted the transfer of US presidential power, leaving five dead and over 140 injured. It is the worst act of violence in Washington, D.C. since 1814 when the British troops set fire to the White House, and it sent shock waves throughout the international community. The US Senate Republican leader described it as a ""failed insurrection"". A scholar from the US Council on Foreign Relations says that the US is not nearly as unique as many Americans believe, and that the Capitol riot should put an end to the notion of American exceptionalism, of an eternal shining city on a hill. An American expert on international issues wrote in TheNew York Timesthat while the US leader has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite America. Trump and his supporters would be willing to depart from established constitutional rules and norms with his Big Lie. This may undermine the ability of the US government to transfer power peacefully and legitimately. Consequently none of the institutions will work for long, and the people will be thrust into political and financial chaos. The dysfunctionalAmerican-style democracyhas triggered a trust crisis. Public commitments to the people come with behind-the-scene deals. Political infighting, money politics, and vetocracy make it virtually impossible for quality governance to be delivered as aspired by the general public. Americans are increasingly disillusioned with the US politics and pessimistic about the American-style democracy. A Gallup survey in October 2020 shows that only 19percentof the Americans surveyed are ""very confident"" about the presidential election, a record low since the survey was first conducted in 2004.According to a poll conducted by The Wall Street Journalin June 2022, six out of 10 Americans feel pessimistic about achieving the American dream. APew Research in 2021 shows that 65 percent of Americans see aneed for major reform to the American democracy. People's confidence in the American democracy dropped in 16 developed countries, and 57 percent of respondents think that the American democracy is no longer a good exampleto follow. The Democracy Perception Index released in 2021bya German polling agency revealsthat 44percentof respondents in the 53 countries surveyed are concerned that the US threatensdemocracy in their country. Over the years, despite the structural flaws and problematic practice of its democratic system, the US has been touting the ""alliance of democracies"" and hyping up the narrative of ""democracy versus autocracy"". It is in essence attacking those whohold different views under the banner of democracy, using ideology and values as atoolto suppressothers and advance its own geopolitical strategies. This is hegemony in the guise of democracy.A former CIA official openly stated: ""We will intervene whenever we decide it\'s in our national security interest to intervene. If you don\'t like it, lump it."" The US has pushed for the neo-Monroe Doctrine in Latin America under the pretext of promoting democracy, incited color revolutionsin Eurasia, and remotely controlled the Arab Spring in West Asia and North Africa. These moves have brought chaos and disasters to many countries, gravely undermining world peace, stability and development.As suggested by the French website Le Grand Soir, democracy has long become a weapon of massive destruction for the US to attack countries with different views. Whether a country is democratic or not depends on whether its people are truly the masters of the country. It depends on whether the people have the right to vote, and more importantly, the right to participate; what promises they are given during elections, and more importantly, how many of these promises are delivered after elections; what kind of political procedures and rules are set through state systems and laws, and more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly enforced; and whether the rules and procedures for the exercise of power are democratic, and more importantly, whether the exercise of power is genuinely subject to public oversight and checks. The Communist Party of China (CPC) leads the Chinese people incarryingoutthe whole-process people's democracy in China. It has not only a complete set of institutions and procedures, but also full-fledged civil participation. A comprehensive, extensive, and well-coordinated system of institutions has been formed to ensure that the people run the country, and diverse, open, and orderly channels for democracy are put into place. This allows the entire people to engage in law-based democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight and to manage state as well as economic, cultural, and social affairs in various ways and forms and in accordance with the law. The whole-process people's democracy integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people's democracy with the will of the state. It is a model of socialist democracy that covers all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society. It is a true democracy that works. China's whole-process people's democracyis gaining wider recognition and acclaim from the international community. A British scholarsays that electoral democracy does not breed a close relationship with the people and government, because the people are only called upon to be involved whenever to make elections take place. The Chinese approach is different in that there is a very important consultative component in the way China operates. Democracy is a concrete phenomenon that is constantly evolving. Rooted in history, culture and tradition, it takes diverse forms and develops along the paths chosen by different peoples based on their exploration and innovation. China stays committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries. China has no intention to engage in systemic rivalry or ideological confrontation with the US. China never exports ideology, never interferes in other countries'internal affairs, and never seeks to change the system of the US. Falsehood 5: The US hasprofound differences with the CPC and the Chinese Government.But those differences are between governments and systems  not between our people. Realitycheck: The CPC's leadership is the choice of history andofthe people. The CPC and the Chinese government enjoy the wholehearted support and endorsement of the Chinese people. The US'sattemptto drive wedgesbetween the CPC and the Chinese peopleonly serves to reveal its animosity against China's system and path. The CPChas deep roots among and close ties with the Chinese people. This is what has kept the CPC full of vigor and vitality. By the end of 2021, the CPC had over 95 million members. The CPC is the largest party in the world thathas exercised long-term governance intheworld's most populous country. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has created the two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. Over 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty and 1.4 billion people are moving toward modernization. Over the course of just several decades, China has accomplished what took western developed countries hundreds of years. A Harvard University survey among the Chinese people spanning 13 years found that more than 90 percent of respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government, the highest rate among countries for years running. A trust and credibility survey released in 2022 by Edelman, a renowned US public relations consultancy firm,shows that as many as 91 percent Chinese citizens trust their government in 2021, the highest among all surveyed countries. The previous US administration, in a McCarthyism-style campaign, went all out toattack anddiscredit the CPC. It has attacked Chinese leaders and China'sdomestic and foreign policies, sown discord between the CPC and the Chinese people, flagrantly challenged the leadership and governing positionof the CPC, incited anti-China and anti-CPCsentiment, and imposed visa restrictions on CPC membersand their families. The current administration, since its inauguration,has made no substantive changes to those policies. In June 2021, the US Senate passed the United StatesInnovation and Competition Act of 2021, which is more than 2,000 pages long. It regarded China as a strategic competitor and the main challenge to the US, slandered China\'s development path and domestic and foreign policies, and malignantly urged actions to counterthe ""influenceand malignactivities"" of the CPC. Itasked for more than 200 billionUS dollarsof public funding to ensure USadvantages in key technologysectorsoverChina, and advocated mobilizingUSresources in strategic, diplomatic, economic, and technological realmsto engage in comprehensive strategic competition with China. The US Senate also proposed an appropriation of 300 million US dollars for each ofthe fiscal years 2022 through2026 to ""counter the malign influence"" of the CPC and designated the US Department of State and Agency for International Development to train journalists on investigative techniques necessary to ensure public accountability related to the Belt and Road Initiative, including ""supporting civil societyand independent media"". The US continues to use the CPC backgroundas a pretext forcrackingdown onnormal people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. For some time, Chinese students and visiting scholarsgoing to the UShave been harassed and suppressed by the US. Most of them were asked whether they or their parents areCPC members. Some were repatriated on inconceivable grounds, such as being suspected of military connections simply because they had photos in their mobile phones of military training atcollege. These stop-and-search activities go far beyond what the US claims as ""normal law enforcement"". The CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people shareaninseparable bond. The US says it respects the Chinese people, thenit should respect the development path and political system chosen by the Chinese people and respect the CPC thatrepresents the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. By targeting the CPCand the Chinese government, the US is in effect targeting the Chinese people. Anything done to separate the CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people and pit the Chinese people against the CPC and the Chinese government will surely be met with the unanimous opposition and resolute response of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people. Falsehood6: The United States raises human rights issues and calls for change  not to stand against China, but to stand up for peace, security, and human dignity. Reality Check: The human rights of the Chinese people are guaranteed like never before, with a notable increase in their sense of fulfillment, happiness and security. In contrast, the US has been engaged in grave human rights violations both at home and abroad, and its shocking track record makes it the biggest human rights abuser in the world. China always puts people's right to subsistence on top of its agenda, prioritizes the work to enhance their right to development, regards the protection of citizens' lawful rights and interests as its basic task, has made the safeguarding of the rights of ethnic groups an important part of itswork, and considers the protection of people's safety its long-term goal. Guided by a people-centered philosophy, since the day when it was founded, the CPC has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its mission. For the past 100 years, the Party has been working tirelessly for the interest of the people, and has dedicated itself to realizing people's aspirations for a better life. China has been advancing whole-process people's democracy, promoting legal safeguard for human rights, and upholding social equity and justice. The Chinese people now enjoy fuller and more extensive and comprehensive democratic rights. China has created the miracle of eliminating absolute poverty. By the end of 2020, China has lifted all 98.99 million rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty.In 2021, China completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and historically resolved the problem of absolute poverty. Since the launch of reform and opening-up, 770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty as currently defined. Based on the international poverty line of the World Bank, China accounts for 70percentof global poverty reduction over the same period. China met the poverty reduction goal of the UN 2030 AgendaforSustainable Developmentten years ahead of schedule, making major contributions to global poverty reduction and human rights progress. China has also put in place the world's largest education system, the largest social security system and the largest health care system. Since COVID-19 started, China has been acting on the principle ofputting the people and their lives first. Based on China's national conditions, it has formulated and implemented a dynamic zero-COVID guideline, and has been constantly fine-tuning its response measures in light of the evolving situation, to best protect people's life and health and at the same time, ensure sustained, sound and steady socioeconomic development with the pandemic under effective control. Both the infection rate and mortality rate of China are the lowest in the world. As an active participant in global human rights governance, China has made its contribution to and offered its initiatives on world human rights development. In recent years, the concept of ""building a community of shared future"" has been written into the resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council, and China-sponsored resolutions on ""the contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights"" and on ""Promoting Mutually Beneficial Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights"" were adopted multiple times at the Human Rights Council. China also made joint statements on behalf of developing countries on the implementation of the right to development, the promotion of human rights by poverty alleviation, equitable distribution of vaccines, among other subjects, contributing its share to safeguarding the basic human rights of developing countries, which has won it wide recognition and support from the international community. Chinahas been an advocate and a doer in advancing the international human rights cause. A World Bank study estimates, if implemented fully, the Belt and Road Initiative could lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty  those who live on less than $3.2 a day. It shows how participating in Belt and Road cooperation can advance human rights in more countries. In the face of the pandemic, China launched itslargest global humanitarian operation since the founding of the People's Republic, and championed the building of a global community of health for all. To address the global development deficit, China proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) whichsees improving people's welfare and achieving well-rounded human development as the fundamental purpose and goal. The GDI has been echoed and supported by more than 100 countries and many international organizations including the UN. The Initiative galvanizes extensive international consensus for accelerated implementation of the UN 2030 AgendaforSustainable Development, and builds up international synergy for coordinated development, thus providing a strong underpinning for the advancement of the international human rights cause. The right to life is of utmost importance, as survival is the basis of allhuman rights. Endowed with the world's most advanced medical equipment and technologies, the US has registered the world's largest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Pandemic response has been extremely politicized, and become a tool and lever to attack, undercut and oppose each other between the Republicans and the Democrats.Politicians only focus on political gains, with no regard to the life and health of the ordinary people. Its pandemic control, which has been unscientific, unequal and irresponsible, has gravely undermined American people's right to life and health. So far, the COVID-19 death toll in the US has surpassed one million. The deaths are, according to The Atlantic, ""unexpected, untimely, particularly painful, and, in many cases, preventable"". Some politician even suggestedthat old people maysacrifice themselves for the country and that saving the country\'s economy is more important than old people\'s lives. Dataof the US Center for Disease Prevention and Control shows that most COVIDvictims areaged 65 years and above. USC and Princeton researchers project thatdue to the pandemic deaths last year, life expectancy at birth for Americans will shorten by 1.13 years, the sharpest decline since World War II.""For Blacks,thelife expectancywouldshorten by2.10 years,and for Latinos,by3.05 years.Whites are also impacted,buttheirprojected decline ismuchsmaller0.68 years."" TheWashington Postpoints to a far greater number behind the one million death toll: That number is 9 million the number of Americans who have lost spouses, parents, grandparents, siblings and children to COVID. A study by the Imperial College London estimates that morethan250,000US childrenhadlost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19 by 23 May 2020. Figures released by the US Government Accountability Office in March2022 show that up to 23 million people in the US may have developed ""longCOVID"", and an estimated one million people suffering from the symptoms may be pushed out of work. The US is the country most rampant with gun violence. Its population, totaling 333 million or 4 percent of the world's total, own more than 400 million guns or 46 percent of all the private guns in the world. It tops the world in terms of gun ownership, and shooting incidents every now and then in the US takes away more than 110 lives on a daily average. Many people say it is easier to buya gun than baby formula in the US. Data of the US website Gun Violence Archive show about 45,000 Americans are killed in gun violence incidents in 2021. On 24 May 2022, the Robb elementary school shooting in Texas claimed 21 lives, including 19 children. By US media counts, it is the 39th campus shooting this year. According to TheWashington Posttally,202 mass shootings tookplace in the US inthe firstfive and half months this year.For decades, no substantive measures have been taken by the US government to address such problems. In the past 25 years, the US federal government fails to introduce any gun control act. The New York Timesobserved, ""The United States has become ungovernable not because of political differences or protest or a lack of civility, but because this is a country unwilling to protect and care for its citizens its women, its racial minorities and especially its children."" Despite the claim by US founding fathersthat ""All men are created equal"", slavery was preserved in its Constitution of 1789. Although the US has abolished segregation on the surface, white supremacy continues to wreak havoc, and systemic discrimination against racial minorities still exists even to this day. Theentrenched racism, compounded by the coronavirus, has fueled a new spike of hate crimes against Asian-Americans. At the same time, racial persecution of the indigenous people persists, discrimination against the Muslim community worsens, racial economic divide yawns, and racial inequality aggravates day by day. Nearly 60 years on since Martin Luther King\'s ""I Have A Dream"" speech, people still see a brutal reality as reflected in George Floyd\'s ""I can\'t breathe"" plea. Through slaughter, expulsion, sterilization and forced assimilation, the UScommitted a genocide against Native Americans,resulting in a sharp drop in theirpopulation from fivemillion in 1492 to 250,000 in the early 20th century. The Native American community has long been neglected and discriminated against. The indigenous culture was fundamentally crushed, and the inter-generational inheritance of indigenous lives and spirits was under severe threats. Many US government statistical programs either leave them outcompletelyor simply classify them as ""others"". Shannon Keller O'Loughlin, Chief Executive and Attorney of the Association on American Indian Affairs, said that Native Americanshave diverse cultures and languages, but are often seen not as an ethnic group, but as a political stratum with limited autonomy based on treaties with the federal government.The Atlanticcommented that from the expulsion, slaughter and forced assimilationbackin history to the current widespread poverty and neglect, the American Indians, once the owner of this continent, now have a very weak voice in American society. The US government enforced the system of boarding schools in Native American areas to impose Englishand Christian education on Native American children. It also enacted laws prohibiting Native Americans from performing religious rituals which have been passed down through generations. An article titled ""The United States Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides"" carried by Foreign Policy website on 11 October 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, there were more than 350 government funded indigenous boarding schools across the US. Hundreds of thousands of indigenous children passed through, or died in, these schools. The purpose of Indian boarding schools was to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly relocating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities where their American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were to be forcibly suppressed. The US was not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people. Native American writer Rebecca Nagle believes that information about Native Americans has been systematically removed from mainstream media and popular culture. According to a report by National Indian Education Association, 87 percentof state-level US history textbooks do not mention the post-1900 history of indigenous people. According to the Smithsonian Institution, things taught about Native Americans in American schools are full of inaccurate information and fail to present the real picture of the sufferings of indigenous people. Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator, saidpubliclyat the Young America\'s Foundation that ""We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here... but candidly, there isn\'t much Native American culture in American culture."" Islamphobia and the discrimination against and suppression of Muslims and Islam in US mainstream society has become more pronounced. A Bloomberg report on 9 September 2021 observed that discrimination against Muslims in the US increased in the two decades after 9/11. On the same day, the Associated Press cited a survey which found that 53 percent of Americans have negative views toward Islam. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in its 2021 report that it receives an increasing number of complaints each year about bullying and hate speechagainstMuslims. According to the survey findings released by the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley on 29 October 2021, 67.5 percent of Muslim respondents said they had experienced Islamophobia, and an even larger percent of those surveyed, 93.7 percent, said that anti-Muslim hatred had affected their mental or emotional well-being to some degree. The US has serious problems of human trafficking and forced labor. It still has not ratified the Forced Labour Convention (1930), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Every year, nearly 100,000 people are smuggled into the US for forced labor. Today, there are at least half a million people enslaved in the US; roughly 240,000 to 325,000 women and children are victims of sexual slavery. Immigrants and refugees have become a tool of partisan feuding and political rivalry in the US. The government changes its rules and regulations capriciously, enforces laws violently, and immigrants have been subjected to inhuman treatment such as prolonged detention, torture and forced labor. Data released by US Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the US, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. That same year, the US detained more than 1.7 million immigrants at the southern border, including 45,000 children. In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. US border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging toward the crowds to expel them into the river. CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. Turning a blind eye to the systematic violation of the human rights of its own people, the US government has wilfully attacked other countriesand interfered intheir internal affairsin the name of human rights, challenging rightwith might and trampling on justice out ofselfish interest. Since 2001, the US has waged war or conducted military operationsin about 80 countries in the name of ""war on terror"", resulting in the deaths of more than 900,000 people, including 300,000 civilians. The 20-year-long war waged by the US has left Afghanistan devastated and impoverished. A total of 47,245 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers unrelated to 9/11 have been killed and more than 10 million displaced as a result of US operations. The War in Afghanistan has destroyed the foundation of economic development and impoverished the Afghan people. When the US withdrew from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central bank, pushing the Afghan economy to the brink of collapse and making things worse for the Afghan people. At the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council, many countries denounced the US as ""the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world""and urged it to address its own gross human rights problems. The US has been an expert in arbitrary detention and torture. Under the pretext of ""war on terror"", the CIA has set up black sites in at least 54 countries and regions over the years, where more than 100,000 people are detained. A group of independent human rights experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council said in a statement released on 10 January 2022 that the US has arbitrarily detained people without trial and subjected them to torture or ill-treatment in Guantanamo Bay for 20 years in violation of international human rights law, calling this ""a stain on the US Government\'s commitment to the rule of law"". The US should face up to and resolve its own systemic and chronic human rights problems, reflect on the humanitarian disasters and crimes it has caused around the world, and give a responsible account of itself to the international community. Falsehood7: The USremains committed to its""one China"" policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, the Six Assurances. Its policy on Taiwan has not changed. Reality Check:The one-China principle isan established norm of international relations and a universal consensus of the international community. The US has acted faithlessly, kept regressing from its own commitments and the consensus it reached with China, and attempted to weaken and undermine the one-China principle and use Taiwan to contain China. This is a major threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted, with an overwhelming majority,Resolution 2758,which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People\'s Republic of China in the UN, and has solved once and for all the issue of China\'s representation in the UN in political, legal and procedural terms. The official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat pointed out explicitly that ""the United Nations considers \'Taiwan\' as a province of China with no separate status"", the ""\'authorities\' in \'Taipei\' are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status"", and ""Reference to \'Taiwan\' ... should read \'Taiwan, Province of China\'"". Onthe basis of the one-China principle, China has established diplomatic relations with 181 countries, including the US. The US made the following commitments to China regarding the one-China principle in the three China-US joint communiqus. In the Shanghai Communiqu released in 1972,the US explicitly stated that ""The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position"". In the Joint Communiqu on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations released in 1978, the US clearlystated that ""The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People\'s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China"";""The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"". In the August 17 Communiqu released in 1982, the US unequivocally stated that ""In the Joint Communiqu on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on January 1, 1979, issued by the Government of the People\'s Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America, the United States of America recognized the Government of the People\'s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and it acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"", and that ""it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China\'s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of \'two Chinas\' or \'one China, one Taiwan\'"". According to this Communiqu, ""the United States Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. In so stating, the United States acknowledges China\'s consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this issue"". Ratherthan faithfully abiding by its commitments on Taiwan, the US has kept backpedaling on history. On the political front, the US has added the so-called ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and the ""Six Assurances"" to the expression of its one-China policy, with a growing list of such prefixes. Both prefixes are unilaterally made by the US side in breach of its commitments in the three China-US joint communiqus as well as the one-China principle affirmed in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and widely observed by the international community. They are illegal, null and void from the very beginning, and China has never acknowledged and has firmly rejected them from the outset. The US has also violated its commitment of maintaining unofficial relations only with Taiwan and kept upgrading the level of engagement. In recent years, senior US officialsincluding the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Under Secretary of State as well as members of Congress have visited Taiwan. US ambassadors overseas have also met with Taiwan\'s so-called ""representatives"" in their host countries. In the military field, the US has reneged on its commitment ""that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution"". Instead of ceasing the arms sales, it has sold weapons at a larger scale and with enhanced capability including assault weaponries such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy weight torpedoes, and F-16V fighter jets. To date, the total volume of US arms sales to Taiwan has exceeded 70 billion US dollars. According to reports by Reuters and other new agencies, US special operations forces have been rotating into Taiwan on a temporary basis to train with Taiwanese forces. Since2021, the US leader has stated publicly on three occasions that the US would help defend Taiwan in case of a war in the Taiwan Strait. On the international stage, the US has been assisting Taiwan in expanding its so-called ""international space"". Recently, the US has been spreading globally the fallacy that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not determine the status of Taiwan, and that each country should be able to determine the contours of its own ""one China""policy.It has vigorously advocated support for Taiwan\'s participation as an observer in the 75th session of the World Health Assembly, and even blatantly helped to consolidate Taiwan\'s ""diplomatic relations"". These US acts have breached its commitment that ""it has no intention of ... pursuing a policy of \'two Chinas\' or \'one China, one Taiwan\'"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2022, former US Secretary of State HenryKissinger said, ""my understanding of the agreement (China and the US reached upon the establishment of diplomatic relations) has been that the United States would uphold the principle of one China ...it is essential that these principles be maintained, and the United States should not by subterfuge or a gradual process, develop something of a two-China solution"". The DPP authorities have been stubbornly advancing its ""Taiwan independence"" separatist agenda, and the US has been encouraging and supporting ""Taiwan independence"" forcesovertly and covertly. This is the root cause of current tensions across the Taiwan Strait. To defend peace across the Taiwan Strait and beyond, we must forestall the growing tendency of ""Taiwan independence"" and the collusion between the US and Taiwan. The one-China principle must not be challenged. China\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be infringed upon. And the red line that no one should pursue a policy of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"" must not be crossed. China is fully confident, capable and prepared to resolutely curb ""Taiwan independence"" separatist activities, resolutely foil all external interferences, and firmly safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US should abide by the provisions in the three China-US joint communiqus, follow a true one-China policy, and act on its commitments including on not supporting ""Taiwanindependence"". The US needs to genuinely reflect on and redress its regressive and erroneous behavior, and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question. Otherwise, it would gravely jeopardize peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, undermine China-US relations and incur an unbearable cost on itself. Falsehood 8: The United States stands with countries and people around the world against the genocide and crimes against humanity happening in the Xinjiang region, where more than a million people have been placed in detention camps because of their ethnic and religious identity. Reality Check: The human rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully protected. There is no ""genocide""or ""crimes against humanity""in Xinjiang. The US has been spreadingdisinformation about Xinjiangsimplyto create an excuse fordiscreditingand attackingChina. Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, but about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism. According to figures available,between1990 andthe end of 2016, there were several thousand incidents of violent and terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, killing large numbers of innocent people and hundreds of police officers, and causing immeasurable property damage. In response tosuchreal threats, Xinjiang has acted resolutelyto fight terrorism and extremism in accordance with law. At the same time, a series of supporting measureshave been taken, like improving people's livelihoods, raising public awareness about law, and offering help through vocational education and training centers. The trend offrequent terrorist activitieshas thus been effectively curbed. There has been no violent act of terrorismin Xinjiang for five consecutive yearsand more. The region has enjoyed security, social stability and good development. The safety and securityof people of all ethnic groupshave been effectively protected. ""Genocide""in Xinjiang is a complete ""lie of the century"". Over the past 60 years and more, the Uyghur population has increasedfrom 2.2 million to about 12 million, and theiraverage life expectancy has grownfrom 30 to 75years. With stabilityprevailing in Xinjiang, local people live and work in peace and happiness.The region has made unprecedented progressin delivering economic and social development and in bettering people's lives. Between 2014 and 2019, GDPin Xinjiang rosefrom 919.59 billion yuan to 1.36 trillion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent, while per capita disposable income grewby an average annual rate of 9.1 percent. Remarkable achievements have been made in eliminating extreme poverty. All 3.09 million impoverished people by current standardshave been lifted out of poverty, making absolute poverty a thing of the past in Xinjiang. The lawfulrights and interests of the people of all ethnicitiesin Xinjiang have been protectedeffectively. All ethnic groups, regardless of their populations, have equallegal status and enjoy freedom of religious beliefand various rights in accordance with law, includingparticipatingin the management of state affairs, receiving education, using their own languages, and preserving their traditional culture. In July 2019, permanent representatives of more than 50 countries in Geneva sent a joint letter to the President of the UN Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, praising China's achievements in fighting terrorism, deradicalization and human rights protection. In October 2019, more than 60 countries spoke at the Third Committee of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, commending the tremendous human rights advancement in Xinjiang. In June 2021, more than 90 countries made joint or separate statements at the Human Rights Council in support of China. In the meantime, Canada took the lead in attacking China on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. Just a little over 40 countries echoed Canada's criticism, and none of them are from the Muslim world. In recent years, over2,000 peoplefrom more than 100 countries, including experts, scholars, journalists, diplomatsand religious figures, have visited Xinjiang, witnessing the unity, harmonyand happinessofpeople of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The so-called ""genocide"" in Xinjiang is a lie cooked up by anti-China forces represented bythe anti-China German scholar Adrian Zenz. He is a member of the far-right group ""Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation""sponsored by the US government, and a key figure in an anti-China organization set up by US intelligence agencies. He is also a racist. His ""research""is full of inconsistencies, fabrications and data manipulation. It does not have any academic credibility and cannot be cleared foracademic publication. For example, achartin Zenz\'s ""paper""claims that new IUD placementsin Xinjiangaverage between 800 and 1,400per personeach year,which means each woman in the region would have to undergo four to eight such insertion surgeries every day. This is totally against common sense. On 29June 2020, the JamestownFoundation of the US published a ""research report"" byAdrian Zenz, in which hefalsely accused the Chinese government of committing ""genocide"" against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Uponthe release of the report, US politicians including then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious FreedomSam Brownback, Senator Marco Rubio and House Representative Jim McGovern immediately pitched in to whip up the ""genocide"" accusation. Rubio, McGovern, Senator John Cornyn and Senator RobertMenendezwent on to urge the administration to makea genocidedetermination of China\'s policy on Xinjiang. Contradictingthe conclusion reached by lawyers atthe State DepartmentOffice of the Legal Adviser, Pompeo announcedthat""I have determined that the People\'s Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups"" on 19January2021, the lastday of the previous administration.The current administration has followedthe same positionand continuedto allege ""genocide""inXinjiang. Thisfurther exposes the US\'sreal intentionof political manipulation in the name of human rights. TheWorld Uyghur Congress, an anti-China separatist organization, hired peoplelike Sayragul Sauytbay and Tursunay Ziawudun to make false statementsand spread all kinds of lies about""persecution"". In the 70-plus press conferences held so far by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, falsehoods spreadbyanti-China forceshave been debunked with solid facts. For instance, some ""performers""who claimed to be the victims offorced sterilizationin vocational education and training centers have never been to one. The family members orfriendsreported by some ""performers"" as missing are actually living anormal life in Xinjiang. The false claim about""millions of Uyghurs detained"" in education andtraining centers was initiated and spread by ""Chinese Human Rights Defenders"", an NGO supported by the US government. Based on interviews with eight Uyghurs and rough estimation, the organization came tothe preposterous conclusion that at least 10 percent of the 20 million people in Xinjiang are detained in ""reeducation camps"". The education andtraining centers in Xinjiang are no different in nature from deradicalization centersor communitycorrection and desistance and disengagement programs inmany other countries. It has been proven to bea successful exploration in preventative counter-terrorism and deradicalization, consistent with the principle and spirit of counter-terrorismresolutions including the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategyand the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.At the centers, trainees acquire greater proficiency instandard spoken and written Chinese language and employability, and gaina stronger sense of national identity, citizenship andrule of law. By October 2019, all trainees hadgraduated from the centers. Most of them havesteady employment after finding jobs by themselvesor with the help of the government, or startingup their own businesses. The US and some other Western countries have been making an issue of human rights in Xinjiang in total disregard of the basic reality ofhuman rights protection and development there. It has become a means for them to achievetheirstrategic objective of using Xinjiang as a pretext to contain China.Lawrence Wilkerson, a retired US Army Coloneland chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, said publicly in August 2018 that one ofthe three-fold purpose of the US military\'s presence in Afghanistanis the containment of China ""If the CIA would want to destabilize China, that would be the best way to do it  to form an unrest, and join with those Uyghurs in pushing ... Beijingfrom internal places rather than external"". Falsehood9: The CPC has imposed harsh anti-democratic measures in Hong Kong under the guise of national security. Beijing's quashing of freedom in Hong Kong violates its handover commitments, enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Reality Check: By attacking and smearing the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), what the US is really up to is to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and make Hong Kong a ""bridgehead""for infiltration and interference against the mainland. Hong Kong is China\'s Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely China\'s internal affairs that brook no interference from the US. For a long time, the UShas colluded with the anti-China, destabilizingforces in Hong Kong, interfered in Hong Kong's political agenda, stoked up social tensions, and even directly intervened in Hong Kong affairs. The US Consul-General in Hong Kong publicly criticized the Hong Kong SAR government for the proposed legislative amendments in 2019 and the One Country, Two Systems. Officials from the US Consulate-General in Hong Kong also met with theso-called leaders of the rioters. The rioters openly admitted that they had discussed withtheUS the legislative process of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and urged the US to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to the Hong Kong police. Funded and incited by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)and otherUS government\'s ""white gloves"", anti-China rioters in Hong Kong committedvandalizing, looting and arson in the name of the so-called fight for ""democracy""and ""freedom"", and violently stormed the building of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of Hong Kong. NED even appeared publicly on the street to direct relevant activities, attempting to stage a ""color revolution""in Hong Kong. NED contacted opposition parties, groups and organizations in Hong Kong through its affiliating National Democratic Institute for International Affairs or the National Democratic Institute (NDI). NDI funded the ""1 July marches""orchestrated by the opposition to obstruct legislation on Article 23, funded the participation of opposition parties and groups at workshops and seminars, and provided personal counseling on campaigning skills for their leaders, ran a so-called ""young political leaders program""to support emerging political groups in confronting the government, plotted, together with opposition members of LegCo, a ""five-district referendum"", and directed and funded the opposition and young radicals in orchestrating the illegal ""Occupy Central""movement. According to the NED website, two million US dollars were spent on 11 Hong Kong-related projects in 2020, with a particular focus on disrupting LegCo elections. Key projects include: ""Strengthening Citizen Election Observation"", which offered technical and financial assistance to newly formed destabilizing groups in Hong Kong, and encouraged them to obstruct LegCo elections by means of election monitoring, get-out-the-vote methods, etc.; ""Amplifying Citizens\' Perspectives on Political Participation"", which collected and disseminated survey findings on democratic development, and induced young Hong Kongers to share their political participation experiences on the Internet; ""Supporting Unity Among Student Activists"", which called for better coordination among Hong Kong student groups prior to LegCo elections, and instructed and trained them to build capacity for ""democratic change"" and international communication and to play a role in disrupting electoral order; and ""Building Regional Solidarity and Empowering the Hong Kong Movement"", which sought to strengthen Hong Kong\'s ""democratic movement"" through network building, cultivate next-generation ""leading activists"" in Hong Kong, and set up a network of ""democratic movement"" in Asia. US officials used ""violence"" and ""shame""to describe the storming of the Capitol building by protesters, but labeledthe violent, criminal activitiesin Hong Kongthat assaulted residents and damaged public facilitiesas ""a beautiful sight to behold"".The US police used armored vehicles to disperse demonstrators, abused their force to beat and drive away sit-in demonstrators, and arrested demonstrators after deliberately inducing them to walk on vehicle laneswhich constitutes violation of the law, while discrediting the Hong Kong SAR government\'s law-based actions to protect people\'s rights and the public order as ""violation"" of human rights. This is another display ofUS-stylehypocritical double standardsand exposes its intention to undermine prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and contain Chinaunder the pretextof human rights and democracy. During the150-plus yearsof British colonial rule, there was no democracy in Hong Kongwhatsoever. None of thegovernorswasdemocratically elected by Hong Kong residents. For most of the time, Legco members were directly appointed by the governor. In stark contrast, after the return of Hong Kong, pursuant to the Basic Law, Hong Kong has come to enjoy the executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. Itsresidents are masters of the SAR as provided by law who manage their own affairs within the scope of the high degree of autonomy. They enjoy a wide range of democratic rights and freedoms like never before. This is a fact that every fair-minded person would recognize. The purpose of enacting the National Security Law in Hong Kong is to close the legal loopholes in safeguarding national security in the SAR. It is a legitimate and necessary move to respond toviolent terrorist activities and illegalexternal interferencein Hong Kong. Constitutions of more than 100 countrieshave stipulations that the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms shall not endanger national security. According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and public trial may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety and order.The European Convention on Human Rights has similar provisions. Thenational security law specifically targets four categories of crimes: secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.It seeks to punish a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security and protect the vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong citizens. Itprovides better protection forthe rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents and the high degree of autonomy ofHong Kong enshrined in law. It creates theconditions needed for addressing the deep-seated problems in the economy and concerning people's livelihood. It also helpsmaintain the rule of law and business environment in Hong Kong, ease the concerns of the business communityabout social disorder, and offer better conditions for people from around the world who want to work, invest and live in Hong Kong. Over the past two years or so since the National Security Law was enacted, the rule of law in Hong Kong has been strengthened and better guaranteed. Hong Kong's rule of law index continues to stay among the topin the world. Foreign investors have stronger confidence in the city.Hong Kong is seeing a bright prospect transitioning from chaos to order andto prosperity. According to the 2022 AmChamHong KongBusiness Sentiment Survey releasedearly this year, the number of businessesin Hong Kong optimistic about Hong Kong's business outlookincreasedby 18 percent from the previous year, while the number of businessesthat are pessimistic was down by 17 percent. The legal basis for the Chinese government to govern Hong Kong is the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is not relevant in this regard.As China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, all provisions concerning the UK under the Joint Declaration had been fulfilled. The basic policies regarding Hong Kong stated by China in the Joint Declaration are China\'s declaration of its policies, which have since been fully embodied in the Basic Law enacted by the National People\'s Congress. These policies have not changed; they will continue to be upheld by China.The Joint Declaration does not assign the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong nor give it any right to intervene in Hong Kong affairs after the return of Hong Kong. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or ""right of supervision""over Hong Kong after its return. The Joint Declaration is a bilateral instrument between China and the UK; it does not involve any other country or has anything to do with a third country. Sovereign equality and non-interference are enshrined in international law and are basic norms of international relations. Other countries and organizations have no right to meddle in Hong Kong affairs on the grounds of the Joint Declaration. TheCentral Government of China has unswervingly implemented the policyof One Country, Two Systems. Since Hong Kong's return, the policyof One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomyhasbeen earnestly implementedwithwidely recognized achievements. Practice has fully proven that One Country, Two Systems is the best institutional arrangement for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. The Central Government will continue to ensure that the policy of One Country, Two Systems remains unchanged, is unwaveringly upheld, and in practice is not bent or distorted. Turninga blind eye to the fact that Hong Kong\'s democracy has improvedin waysunseen before its return, the US has acted against Hong Kong\'s mainstream public opinion for unity and progressand madeirresponsible remarks on Hong Kong\'s high degree of autonomy, human rights and freedom as the ""preacher""of democracy. This only exposes itshypocriticaldouble standards and the agenda to destabilize Hong Kong and contain China. Falsehood 10: China purports to champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while standing with and defending the Russian government that brazenly violate them. Reality Check: On the Ukraine issue, China has always adhered to an objective and just position, a position shared by most countries.The Cold War mentality and power politics is the root cause ofthe Ukraine crisis. The US should earnestly shoulder its due responsibilities and take concrete actions to ease the situation and solve the problems. The US has betrayed its own promises and kept pushing for the eastward expansion of NATOcreating the Ukraine crisis. When meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, the then US Secretary of State James Baker gave clear assurances that ""there would be no extension of NATO\'s jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east"". However, the US has led fiverounds of NATO eastward expansion since 1999, increasing its membership from 16 to 30, and advancing NATO more than 1,000 kilometers eastward to the Russian border, forming a C-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea. In 1997, former US diplomat and observer on the Soviet Union George Kennan wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed that ""expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era."" In 2014, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in the Washington Post that if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it should not join NATO, and that it must not be either side's outpost against the other  it should function as a bridge between them. At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2022 in Davos, Kissinger said that Ukraine shouldhave been a bridge between Europe and Russia, but that opportunity does not now exist in the same manner. Russia has been for 400 years an essential part of Europe, and on a number of occasions as the guarantor by which the European balance could be re-established. Current policy should keep in mind the restoration of this role is important to develop. An American expert on international affairs points out in an article that the US government should bear considerable responsibility for the deterioration of relations with Russia caused by its major mistake of greenlighting the NATO expansion. Noting that ""America and NATO aren\'t innocent bystanders"", he also believed that it is ""the height of folly"" for some US officials to brag in public about leaks or even intelligence sharing between the US and Ukraine. He warned that such instigation on the US side could dangerously widen the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. According to Clare Daly, Member of the European Parliament, the US has been adding fuel to the fire on Ukraine because they want to weaken Russia and benefit from the crisis, for which Europe will pay a heavy price. These is still no hope of peace in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, mainly because the US does not want Russia and Ukraine to reach a peace agreement. Former US Senator Bill Bradley said that ""the fundamental blunder that the United States made in the late 80s, early 90s was the expansion of NATO"". Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview if Joe Biden simply promised not to include Ukraine into NATO, the war would have been prevented. Over the years,the US has pursued interventionism and grossly violated the sovereignty of Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, Syria and other countries.Alfred de Zayas, a senior UN expert, said in anexclusive interview that from the perspective of international law, Russia\'s military actions in Ukraine violated the UN Charter, but the United States and NATO have broken international law so often over the years that ""precedents of permissibility"" have therefore been set for Russia\'s current actions in terms of customary international law. TheUS has been fanning the flames on the Ukraine issue. Instead of promoting peace talks, the US continued to provide weapons to Ukraine, escalating tensions and expanding the conflict, making it more prolonged and complicated. This has sufficiently exposed the selfish nature of the US. On 25 April2022, US Defense Secretary Austin said after a visit to Ukraine that the US wants to use the war to ""see Russia weakened"". In late May2022, on top of the original 13.6 billion dollars aid, the US Congress voted to approve another over 40 billion dollars in military and economic aid to Ukraine. The total assistance has exceeded 70percentof the combined military expenditure of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The ongoing crisis has costEurope heavily in political, economic and social aspects, but the US is reaping dividends, with itsarms dealers, food and energy companiesgaining huge profits. For example, the market value of US military industrial giants has surged by hundreds of billions, and the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exported to Europe is more than 10 times higher than a year ago. As the result of the conflict, more than 6.5 million Ukrainians have fled into neighboring European countries, posing an unprecedented refugee crisis. But the US admitted only 12 refugees from Ukraine in March 2022. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees remainstranded on the US-Mexico border, and many were in US custody. Even whenthe UN and the international community are calling for an early end to the conflict, some in the US are still claiming that they would ""fight to the last Ukrainian"". The relationship between China and Russia features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting at any third party. It is essentially different from the practice of the US and a small number of other Western countries, where they still stick to the Cold War mentality and a friend-or-foe dichotomy to draw ideological lines, form so-called ""alliances"" and ""cliques"", pursue bloc politics and create confrontation and division. In the joint statement issued on 4February 2022, China and Russia call on all to champion humanity's common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, respect the rights of all peoples to independently determine the development paths of their countries, and the sovereignty, security and development interests of all countries, protect the UN-centered international system, and the international order based on international law, seek true multilateralism with the UN and its Security Council playing a central and coordinating role, promote more democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development across the world. As a responsible major country, China's decisions and judgments on the Ukraine issue are made independently based on the merits of the matter. China has made great efforts to safeguard international peace and security, and has been committed to promoting talks for peace and deescalating tensions. China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, that legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported. China's position is objective, fair and consistent with the aspirations of most countries. Of the 233 sovereign countries and regions in the world, 185 are not involved in sanctions on Russia. Among the more than 190 members of the UN, more than 140 countries, including NATO member state Turkey, have refused to impose sanctions on Russia. The combined population of countries and regions participating in sanctions against Russia andthose not is 1.1 billion versus 6.5 billion. Among them, those who openly oppose sanctionshave a combined population of 4.8 billion. About two-thirds of the world's population does not support Western positions on Ukraine, according to a report by the British Economist magazine. Falsehood 11: The USis setting up new coalitions in the Indo-Pacific for regional peace and stability, and has launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), as it ""shares the vision that the regional countries and people across the region hold: one of a free and open Indo-Pacific."" Reality Check: The so-called US vision of a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" is essentially a strategy to divide others, incite confrontation and undermine peace. It runs counter to the trend of the times in the Asia-Pacific, i.e., the trend of peaceful development and win-win cooperation. The US administration\'s Indo-Pacific strategy is self-contradictory: the US claims to promote the region\'s ""freedom and openness"" as its goal, while in reality co-opting with allies to forge a ""five-four-three-two-one"" formation made up of the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, bilateral alliances and IPEF, forming exclusive ""small circles"" and forcing countries in the region to take sides. AUKUS helps Australia build nuclear-powered submarines and develops hypersonic weapons, pushing up the risk for a regional arms race. Under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing and keeping supply chains resilient, the Quad has vigorously pursued military cooperation and intelligence sharing. The US has also encouraged NATO\'s involvement in the Asia-Pacific. These are all attempts to materialize an ""Asia-Pacific version of NATO"" and promote ""integrated deterrence"" against China. The Indo-Pacific strategy has raised increasing alarm and concern of many countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific. As BBC reported, in April 2021, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahutaexpressed New Zealand's discomfort with expanding the Five Eyes' remit by putting pressure on China in this way, and New Zealand still prefers to pursue bilateral relations with China. At the US-ASEAN Special Summit, ASEAN countries stressed their aspiration for peace and cooperation, not for taking sides, division or confrontation. The US has made clear that IPEF is to enable it to win the contest in the 21st century. This means that the IPEFis designed to serve the US economy. The US has shelved the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) for a long time, left the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and refused to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This exposes the self-serving nature of the US and its selective approach to international institutions. It is all about the US' self-interests, nothing mutually beneficial. IPEF is a political instrument of the US in propping up its hegemony in the regional economy. The essence is to dominate the supply chains, value chains and new economic sectors, and marginalize specific countries. The US has chosen to weaponize economic issues as political and ideological ones, using economy to coerce regional countries into taking sides between China and the US. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai publicly stated that IPEF is a standalone arrangement independent from China.US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondosaid IPEF marks the US\'s restoration of economic leadership in the region and presents Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China\'s approach.Previously, shealso expressed that IPEF may harmonize export controls and other ""poisonpills"", such as limiting sensitive products export to China. IPEFseeks to establish US-led trade rules, restructure the industrial chain system and economically and scientifically ""decouple""regional countries from China.Many countries in the region getconcerned,and believe that the cost of such ""decoupling""will be huge.Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad noted that any trade alliance that excludes the world\'s second largest economy is not conducive to closer, multilateral trade cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The US\'s exclusion of China is not an economic issue but a political one. Hailed as ""menu approach"" cooperation, IPEF actually pays little regard to the development level and real needs of the regional countries. It barely gives concessions to developing countries on tariff reduction and market access, but forces participating countries to accept the so-called high standards of the USanditsunilateral agenda. IPEF focuses solely on the US\'s self-interests and cares little about the needs of other parties. There is no such thing as mutual benefit in IPEF. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) pointed out in its report ""Regional Perspectives on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework"" that IPEF has little more to offer than enlarging the US economic presence in the region. It fails to address the issues of the greater interests of regional countries. There is widespread concern that IPEF will only benefit the US, while saddling participating regional countries with a heavy burden. Falsehood12: China has announced its ambition to create a sphere of influence in the Pacificregion.It isadvancing unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea, undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation and commerce. The US will continue to oppose Beijing's aggressive and unlawful activities in the South and East China Seas. It will support the region's coastal states in upholding their maritime rights, work with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, and will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows. Reality Check:China is committed to the path of peaceful development, the five principles of peaceful coexistenceand opposesthe practice of the big and strong bullying the small and weak. The US, by painting China as a threat and using ""freedom of navigation"" as a pretext to undermine China\'s sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests, is actually the real threat to regional peace and security. China stands for equality among all countries irrespective of their size, respects every country's choice of developmentpath suited to its national condition, and does not seek any sphere of influence. China pursues a defensepolicy that is defensive in nature and a military strategy of active defense. In developing its defense capabilities, China aims to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, anddoes not target any other country. The growth of China's defense capabilities amplifies the force for peacein the world. China is the first to have discovered, named, and explored and exploitedNanhai Zhudao and relevant waters, and the first to have exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction over them continuously, peacefully and effectively. China's sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao and its relevant rights and interests in the South China Sea have been established in the long course of history. They are solidly grounded in history and law, and have been upheld by successive Chinese governments and recognized by the international community. Pursuant tothe 1943 Cairo Declarationand the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, China recovered territories illegally occupied by Japan including Xisha Qundao and Nansha Qundaoafter WWII, and has since affirmed sovereignty and strengthened jurisdiction by establishing official names, publishing maps, creating administrative units and stationing troops. China's resuming itsexercise of sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao is a legitimate and lawful act to inherit China's rights established over the course of history. It is also part of the post-WWII international order, and has been recognized by countries around the world including the US. With the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the overall situation in the South China Sea remains stable. With the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), the parties have increased dialogue, properly handled differences, deepened cooperation and enhanced mutual trust, and have made active progress in advancing consultations on the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, in an effort to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and inject positive dynamicsinto regional and global security, stability and prosperity. Despite COVID-19, the parties have held offline Senior Officials' Meetings on the implementation of the DOC and 10 joint working group meetings via video link to advance consultations on the COC text. Last month, the first face-to-face COC consultations since COVID-19 was held in Cambodia. Such positive progress speaksvolumes about the resolve and commitment of regional countries to steadfastly advance consultationstoward aCOC. China respects and supports all countries'freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea in accordance with international law, and actively safeguards the security of and unimpeded passage throughinternational shipping lanes. In fact, the South China Sea is one of the world's safest and freest sea lanes. Fifty percent of merchant vessels in the world and one-third of international maritime trade pass through it, and more than 100,000 merchant ships sail through it annually. Freedom ofnavigation and overflight in the South China Sea hasnever been an issue. Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territory.China's patrol and law enforcementmissions in waters off the Diaoyu Dao are legitimate measures taken by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with lawand are necessary responses toJapanese provocations in violation of China's sovereignty. No country or force should misjudge the strong resolve of the Chinese government to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the same time, China stays committed to properly handlingand resolvingissues through dialogue and consultation, and has made great efforts to maintain maritime stability. In 2014, a four-point principled consensus was reached between China and Japan to handle and improve China-Japan relations,which includes a clear understanding on managing the situation surrounding Diaoyu Dao andthe East China Sea. Acting under the logic of theMonroe Doctrine, the US often uses power politics and hegemonicand bullying acts to flagrantly undermine the international maritime order, with a view to sustaining its maritime predominance. In the 240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years when the countrywas not at war with others. The US operates over 800 military bases in 80 countries and regions. Its military expenditure, which has toppedthe world for many years in a row, accounts for one-fourthof the global total and is equivalent to the combined military spending of the next nine countries. Recently, the US has proposed a national defense budget request of about 813 billion US dollars for fiscal year 2023. Such massive military spendingmakes the USthe real ""pacing challenge"" to the world. The US disregards the historyand facts surroundingthe South China Sea issue, deliberately stokes disputes on territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and sows discord among regional countries. It has become the biggest force undermining stability and fueling militarization in the South China Sea. Data from relevantorganizationsshow that the number of US close-in reconnaissance activities targeting China has more than doubled over the past decadeand more. Right now, an average of five US naval vessels cruise near China's shore everyday. This year, US navalvessels have been sailing through the Taiwan Strait about once a month, and large US reconnaissance planes have flown over 800 times close to Chinaand repeatedly violatedChina's airspace. Eager to stir up trouble in theSouth China Sea, the US has also encouraged its allies and partners to sail their naval vessels into the South China Sea. On 2 October 2021, USS Connecticut, anuclear submarine, had an underwatercollision in the South China Sea. It was not until a week laterthat the US issued a vague statement, claiming that the submarine hit an unknown object. One month after, it said that the submarine ""grounded on an uncharted seamount"". A final report on the accident was eventually released by the US Navy on 23 May 2022, yet noclear explanation has been offeredin response to the grave concerns and questions raised by many, including the intent of the submarine, the specific location of the accident, whether the submarine had entered exclusive economic zones (EEZ)andeven territorial sea of other countries, and whether the accident had caused a nuclear leak or damaged marine environment. The US began its Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program in 1979 ahead of the signing of the UNCLOS. Challenging the new maritime order, the move sought tomaximizethe freedom of the US military torampagethrough the oceans. The FON Program is not consistentwith the universally recognized international law, disregards the sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests of the many littoral countries, and seriously jeopardizes regional peace and stability. Its goalis to advance American maritime supremacy under the pretext of ""freedom of navigation"". The FON Programhas been firmly opposed by many members of the international community, especially the developing countries. Falsehood13: Chinese government officials spread disinformation. Reality Check:China is the top victim of disinformation, while the US is the biggest source of spreading disinformation. With sharp confrontation between the Republicans and Democrats, habitual lying, finger-pointing and blame-shifting among politicians have become part of the US political ecology. A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Pearson Institute at the University of Chicago reveals that nearly half of the respondents blame the US government for the spread of misinformation. The US has used disinformation to launch multiple wars across the globe in pursuit of its hegemonic agenda. Colin Powell, the then US Secretary of Stateaccused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destructionwith a test tube of ""laundry powder"". The US blamed the Syrian government for using bio-chemical weapons against its own peoplewith fake videos by the White Helmets. In 2019, the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly claimed that ""we lied, we cheated, we stole  we had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment."" On4 May 2022, Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke bluntly at a Senate hearing, ""Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The US government."" Manipulation by US politicians has seriously undercut themedia'scredibility. A Gallup poll in 2020 shows that 60 percent ofAmericans remain largely distrustful ofthe media, among whom33percenthave no trust at all, which is 5 percentage points higher than that of 2019. The US has on multiple occasions fabricated numerous lies and rumorson issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, democracy and human rights, including the so-called ""lab-leak theory"", ""genocide"" and ""forced labor"", which have all been defeated by facts. Sincethe Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US has kept spreading disinformation on China and made unfounded accusations against it, in order to shirk its responsibilities for triggering the conflict withNATO's eastward expansion. The New York Timesquoted from anonymous US senior officials who claimed that China had prior knowledge of Russian military operation in Ukraine. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Representative to the UN, said at a Security Council meeting that Chinahad been spreading disinformation in support of Russia. This is sheer fabrication and slandering. Meanwhile, as part of the fierce hunt of voices different from its own, the US has added special labels to Tweets sharing links of Chinese media reports, while turning a blind eye to the Western media that are actually telling the lies. The US has used disinformation as a political tool to attack and suppress China, and formed a supply chain of anti-China rhetoric combining dirty funding, fact-twisting stories and massive smear campaigns. On the surface, these anti-China rhetoric come from certain media outlets and politicians, but what lies underneath is a massive capital-driven supply chain  some institutions and organizations from the US and other Western countries provide dirty funding for political purposes to anti-China groups and individuals; some think-tanks and academic institutions make up fact-twisting stories to fuel anti-China rhetoric around the world through Western hegemony on public opinion; and politicians and media act as mouthpieces propagating lies and falsehoods about China in massive smear campaigns. Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), both fabricated numerous Xinjiang-related lies, are typical examples of such ""lies manufacturers"". Adrian Zenz is a member of a far-right group founded by the US government and a key member of an anti-China research institute set up and manipulated by the US intelligence agency. His so-called reports on Xinjiang reflect no credibility, intellectual merit or academic integrity at all. As disclosed by the media, the US State Department and arms manufacturers are the primary foreign sponsors for the ASPI. Funding from the US State Department alone reached nearly 1.4 million Australian dollars a year, all directed to research projects attacking China. The ASPI disseminated a series of lies and disinformation on issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang and data security. In addition to constantly spreading disinformation on China, the US has also rolled out measures to suppress and contain China based on such disinformation, including China-related bills and sanctions. In December 2021, under the pretext of its so-called concerns on ""forced labor"", the US signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, imposing a full ban on imports from Xinjiang. This is a malicious move to denigrate human rights situation in Xinjiang, and a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations. China has used facts and figures to tell the truth and refute the lies and rumors created and propagated by the US. It is aimed at making truth heard, not spreading disinformation. Instead of observing basic facts, the US has acted in its own interests and labeled all views different from its own as ""disinformation"". This is, in essence, hegemony and bullying in the field of public opinion. Falsehood 14: China is circumventing or breaking trade rules and its economic manipulations have cost American workers millions of jobs, harming workers and companies in the United States but also around the world.The United States will push back on market-distorting policies and practices, like subsidies and market access barriers, which China's government has used for years to gain competitive advantage. Reality Check: China has faithfully delivered on its commitments made upon accession to the WTO. China upholds, builds and contributes to the multilateral trading system. China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial in nature. However, US' wanton suppression of China in trade and investment areas has been the root cause of trade frictions between the two countries, which hurts others without benefiting oneself. Over the past 20-plus years since joining the WTO, China has earnestly fulfilled its commitments upon accession. It has rolled out nationwide the management system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list, kept expanding market access, brought down overall tariff level from 15.3% to 7.4%, and opened up nearly 120 sectors in the service industry. In October 2021, the WTO conducted the eighth review of trade policies and practices of China. The report of the review fully recognized China's efforts in upholding the multilateral trading system and its active role in the WTO. It spoke highly of China's achievements in such areas as trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, greater opening-up and progress under the Belt and Road Initiative. A leading official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development pointed out that, over the past two decades, China has steadfastly supported the rules-based multilateral trading system, practiced true multilateralism, participated fully in WTO negotiations, steered negotiations in areas such as investment facilitation and e-commerce, and worked for WTO rules keeping pace with the times. Embracing the trend of regional and global economic integration, China has deepened economic and trade ties with countries around the world, signing free trade agreements and stepping up the building of free trade zones. As of now, China has signed 19 free trade agreements with 26 countries and regions. China has actively deepened supply-side structural reform. It has met the target of phasing out 150 million tons of overcapacity in the steel industry set out in the 13thFive-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, 1.14 times of the global total in slashing overcapacity of steels. The process involved the reemployment of 280,000 Chinese steel workers, more than the total number of steel workers in the US, Europe and Japan. China and the US have highly complementary economies, deeply integrated interests, and mutually beneficial economic and trade ties. In 2021, bilateral trade topped record-breaking 750 billion US dollars. The US Export Report 2022 issued by the US-China Business Council showed that, in 2021, goods exports to China grew by 21 percent to 149 billion US dollars, supporting 858,000 jobs in the US. The 2020 Annual Business Survey Report on Chinese Enterprises in the United States released by the China General Chamber of Commerce-USAindicated that,as of 2019, CGCC's Chinese member companiescumulatively invested over 123 billionUS dollars, employedmore than 220,000 people, and supported over onemillion jobs throughout the United States. Research of the US-China Business Council showed that Chinese exports have helped bring down US consumer price by 1 to 1.5percent, saving each US household 850 US dollars per year. By blaming China for its own economic problems, the US started a trade war and tariff war against China, which only backfired for itself. US tariffs against China have cost American companies more than 1.7 trillion US dollarsin market capitalizationand increased average household expenditure by 1,300 US dollars per year. A 2021 report by the US-China Business Council pointed out that the trade war with China has resulted in a loss of 245,000 jobs in the US. A report from Moody's Investor Service was cited as sayingthat American consumers bear 92.4 percentof the cost of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize laureate in economics, incisively pointed out that US trade policy toward China has failed and tariffs harm the US more than their intended targets. On 18 May 2022, the National Retail Federation (NRF) wrote to President Biden, calling for eliminating tariffs, which, as pointed out in the letter, could reduce consumer prices by as much as 1.3 percent. Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, said that sometariffs on China hurt American consumers and businesses, and that cutting tariffs was worth considering in order to lower US inflation. The obstacles to China-US economic and trade cooperation are mainly from the US side. Over 1,000 Chinese companies have been put on its lists for unfair suppression or sanction. The US Congress has put forth more than 300 negative China-related bills. The proposed Bipartisan Innovation Act, which is still being developed, essentially aims to hold back China's economic growth. The US arbitrarily accuses China of its industrial subsidy policies, but the country itself was among the first to develop such policies, including subsidies and so on. Successive US administrations have rolled out plans to support emerging industries. Through tax relief, government procurement and other means, the US administrations have interfered in the market to push forward cooperation between government and enterprises and advance technology transfers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the US undertook special programsto promote the development of its aerospace and military industries. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration supported the growth of hi-tech industries with the Information Superhighway plan. Such industrial policies are still being practiced in the US today. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the US and its allies and partners in Europe and Asia have increased subsidies to industries such as semiconductors, electric-car batteries and pharmaceuticals to shore up support for domestic companies. The US poses the biggest challenge to the global trading system. Following ""America First"" policy, the US has refused to shoulder its due obligations under multilateral trading agreements, and withdrawn from international treaties and organizations, taking a heavy toll on the development and functioning of the global trading system. A WTO dispute settlement report has identified the US as the biggest rule-breaker, responsible for two-thirds of violations of WTO rules.The US also blocked the appointment of new judges in the WTO Appellate Body, leading to an impasse in the Appellate Body since December 2019. Falsehood 15: The US will give countries an alternative choice, so that they can be free from opaque investments that leave them in debt. Reality Check: In providing foreign assistance, Chinaalways respectsthe sovereignty of recipient countries, attaches no strings whatsoever and pursues win-win outcomes. Chinese assistance has delivered real benefits to the relevant developing countries and received their acclaim and appreciation. The so-called Chinese ""debt trap"" is a narrative trap that the US and some other Western countries use to defame and smear China and disrupt China\'s cooperation with other developing countries. As a 2021 article in The Atlanticpoints out, the debt-trap narrative is just a lie fabricated by some Western politicians, and a powerful one. Western capital constitutes the largest creditor of developing countries. According to the 2022 statistics of the World Bank on international debt, 28.8 percent ofAfrica's outstandingexternal debtis owed to multilateral financial institutions and 41.8 percent to commercial creditors mainly composedof Western financial institutions. These two types of institutions togetherhold nearly three-quarters of the debt, making them the primary creditorsof Africa's debt. According to the director of the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at Johns Hopkins University of the US, after scrutinizing thousands of Chinese loan documents, mostly for projects in Africa, CARI has not found any evidence that China deliberately pushes poor countries into debt as a way of seizing their assets or gaining a greater say in their internal affairs. CARI's figures show that China holds 17 percent of Africa's overall external debt, far less than that of the West. Not a single African country has been forced to useits strategic resources such as ports or mines as collateral for financing cooperation with China. DW points out that the default of African countries does not give China the right to use the relevant infrastructure. The debt issue is, in essence, a developmentissue. The key to resolving this issue lies in ensuring that the loans deliver real benefits. Take Africa as an example. Western countries' financing for Africa is mainly concentrated in non-production fields, and most loans come with political strings attached, such as human rights and judicial reform. They have failed to truly promote economic development, boost government tax revenue and improve balance of payments. Rather, they have served asinstruments forcontrolling and causingharm inAfrica. China alwaysrespectsthe will of the African people and bearsin mind the actual needs of African countries. Chinese investment in and financing for Africa are mainly in infrastructure building and production-related fields. Enteringthe 21st century, China has worked actively to support Africa's economic developmentandprovided an alternative to the traditionalfinancing channelsofthe Paris Club. This has helped Africato strengthenitscapacity of self-generated and self-reliant developmentandto usher in a golden age of high-speedeconomic growth for 20 years straight. Professor Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University noted the diversification of Chinese investment. In 2014 alone, Chinese companies signed over 70 billion US dollars in construction contracts in Africa that will yield vital infrastructure, including hospitals, oil and gas pipelines, and airports. According to preliminary statistics, between 2000 and 2020, China helped African countries build more than 13,000 kilometers of roads and railway and more than 80 large-scale power facilities, funded more than 130 medical facilities, 45 sports venues and more than 170 schools, and trained more than 160,000 professionals across various fields for Africa. TheNairobi Expresswayproject built by Chinese companies in Kenyathrough public-private partnership has created more than 6,000 local jobs and benefited more than 200 subcontractors and several hundred local suppliers. The Kenyan government speaks highly of the project, commendingit as an important manifestation of the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between Kenya and China. Nigeria's Lekki Deep Sea Port project, built with Chinese participation, has provided more than 1,200 local jobs and is expected to create, directly and indirectly, 170,000 more upon completion. A study conducted by Hong Kong scholars finds that more than 80 percent of the employees of Chinese companies in Africa surveyed are local Africans. A team at the London School of Economics and Political Science finds that Chinese investment in Africa has produced ""significant and persistently positive long-term effects"". A study by RAND Corporation indicates that in the BRI region, having a rail connection between trading partners has improved total exports by 2.8 percent. China attaches high importance to the debt sustainability of projects. Back in 2017, it signed the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Roadwith 26 countries participating in the BRI. In 2019, China released the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative. Based on the debt situation and repayment ability of debtor countries, and following the principles of equal-footed consultation, compliance with laws and regulations, openness and transparency, the framework aims to strengthen monitoring and assessment of the economic, social and livelihood benefits of the projects, and channels sovereign loans into areas with high yields, with a view to ensuring the long-term returns of the projects. China has also made proactive efforts to lessen the burden of debtor countries. According to the World Bank, between 2008 and 2021, China provided 71 debt restructurings for low-income countries. In 2020, China actively responded to the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) by suspending the payment of more than 1.3 billion US dollars of debt that year alone, or nearly 30 percent of the G20's total, making it the largest contributor among G20 members. China has signed debt suspension agreements or reached mutual understanding on debt suspension with 19 African countries, and actively participated in the case-based debt settlement for Chad and Ethiopia under the G20's Common Framework. The US and some other Western countries, rather than taking actions themselves, point fingers at China for providing assistance. This has caused much displeasure among countries in the wider developing world. Professor Samita Hattige, adviserto the National Education Commission of Sri Lanka, saidin an interview with Global Times that Chinese loans are based on the needs of the Sri Lankan government and for the purpose of improving Sri Lankan infrastructure. The loans have brought major changes to Sri Lanka\'s economy and people\'s livelihood, and there is no such thing as a ""debt trap"". China\'s share in Sri Lanka\'s external debt is around a mere 10 percent. Apparently, some media have chosen to ignore this fact. While the ""Chinese debt trap"" hyped up by Western media seems apprehensible at a glance, it has deliberately evaded the huge economic values that infrastructure improvement has created, such as economic development and more jobs and investment. The article ""Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal Need China for Development"" published by Sri Lanka\'s Daily Newson 17 January 2022 says, ""South Asia needs China in its development process because China is synonymous with the term \'Development\'. China\'s ... Belt and Road Initiative provides benefits for almost all South Asian countries."" ""In the case of Sri Lanka,"" the article writes,""Sri Lanka is a beneficiary of Chinese projects. Many say only about the Chinese debt trap in this regard but no one mentions Chinese developmental activities in Sri Lanka."" ""They have invested heavily in seaports, airports, ... national highways, and power distribution centers. "" Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni stated in an interview with Nikkei in 2022 that ""Africa has been having (debt) problems for the last 600 years due to the slave trade, colonialism, neocolonialism  and none of it was from China."" ""China supported Africans\' fight against colonialism before starting economic activity on the continent."" Rwandan President Paul Kagame pointed out that China\'s presence in Africa is different from that of other countries  ""I don\'t think China has forced any country in Africa to take their money to accumulate the kind of debt you may find with some countries."" Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama stated that Nigeria had chosen Chinese companies for infrastructure projects because they were experienced and provide competitive rates. ""So the issue of Chinese influence really doesn\'t come in. Falsehood 16: For too long, Chinese companies have enjoyed far greater access to our markets than our companies have in China. American companies operating in China have been subject to systematic forced technology transfer, while Chinese companies in America have been protected by our rule of law. Reality Check: China is committed to fostering an enabling business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standard. While China's business environment keeps improving, the business environment for Chinese companies operating in the US continues to deteriorate. China has seen the most substantial improvement in business environment among all economies. In recent years, China has made continuous efforts to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, improved the institutions for investment promotion and protection and for information reporting, and stepped up intellectual property protection, becoming one of the most-improved economies for ease of doing business. With the continuous improvement in business environment and its super-sized domestic market, China is a strong magnet for cross-border investment from around the world. The number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises is on a steady rise in China. From 2012 to 2021, the number of foreign-invested enterprises in China increased from 441,000 to 664,000, up by over 50percent. According to the Doing Business 2020report released by the World Bank Group, China ranked 31st on ease of doing business, moving up by 47 spots in two years. The European Business in China Business Confidence Survey 2021released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) shows that a majority of the European companies surveyed found intellectual property rights enforcement to be ""adequate"" or ""excellent"" in China, marking a record high in satisfaction levels. It is the foreign companies, including the US companies operating in China, that can best tell whether China's business environment is good or not. The 2022 China Business Climate Survey Reportof the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) shows that 58 percent of the US companies in China saw their operating revenue growing in 2021; 66 percent of the companies plan to increase their investment in China this year; and China remains a top-three priority of the global investment planning for 60percentof the companies. The recently released USCBC 2021 Member Surveyshows that 95 percent of the respondents remained profitable in their China operations; and 74 percent of the companies took China as a top priority or a top-five priority market in their business strategy. In the first four months of 2022, the actual US investment in China rose by 53.2 percent year on year. These figures speak volume about the optimism of foreign companies in China's economic prospects, as well as their recognition of China's sound business environment and confidence in building a long-term business in the Chinese market. To preserve its hegemony and economic interests, the US has abused its national power in violation of the principles of market economy and international trade rules, and resorted to every possible means to suppress and contain Chinese enterprises. The US government has fabricated all sorts of lies including ""forced labor"" in an attempt to bring down Xinjiang\'s cotton, tomato and solar photovoltaic industries. According to preliminary statistics, in 2021, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued seven Withhold Release Orders (WROs) on the exports of goods made with ""forced labor"" to the US, including apparel, textiles, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and other goods made with cotton or tomatoes, silica-based products and electronic products produced in Xinjiang, and detained or confiscated 485 million US dollars worth of goods, which are notably larger in both quantity and value compared to 2020. The current US administration has already outperformed its predecessor in terms of the scale and magnitude of sanctions imposed on China for Xinjiang-related issues. The US has imposed sweeping restrictions on the financing and operation of Chinese enterprises in the US through non-transparent and unfair administrative means. According to official US statistics, the US has up to now put 1,055 Chinese entities and individuals (overseas affiliated entities excluded) on various types of sanctions lists, including 467 on the Entity List, 306 on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN), 201 on the Unverified List (UVL), 68 on the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List, and a few other entities. Last February, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) put WeChat and AliExpress on its latest Notorious Markets List, while Pinduoduo and other Chinese companies as well as nine physical markets located within China remained on the list. Falsehood 17: China takes advantage of the openness of the US economies to spy, to hack, to steal technology and know-how to advance China's military innovation, entrench its surveillance state and increase other countries' technological dependence. The US should make sure that technologies are rooted in democratic values. Reality check:China's technological innovation and development is based on its own investment and efforts. The US is drawing ideological lines inscientific and technologicalexchanges and cooperation, and this embodies its Cold War mentality. China is a big innovator in the world with leading input and growth rate in innovation. According to statistics, China's social R&D investment in 2021 reached 2.7864 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.2percentover the previous year. A total of 696,000 invention patents were authorized in 2021, up by 31.3 percent year-on-year. The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2021 published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that China's world innovation performance ranking has moved up from the 35th place to the 12th. China is now home to 19 of the top 100 science and technology clusters worldwide, ranking the second globally. Chinese applicants submitted 69,500 international patent applications, making China the first in the world for three consecutive years. The European Patent Office (EPO) recorded 16,665 applications from China in 2021, registering a year-on-year increase of 24 percent and the biggest surge among leading patent filing countries. In recent years, China has been actively integrating into the global science and technology innovation network,and has enjoyed fruitful results in technological and people-to-people exchanges under the BRI. In addition, China has also actively worked to join the Hague Agreement and the Marrakesh Treaty, contributing its shareto the global governance of intellectual property rights. The Business Confidence Survey 2021 publishedby the EUCCC shows that over half of interviewed companies view intellectual property rights enforcementin China as""adequate"" or ""excellent"". Throughout history, the US has repeatedly stolen intellectual properties and reaped dividends from technological developments through various means, including pryingoutinformation, offering immigration status and monopolizing patents. After World War II, the US launched Operation Paperclip to plunder Germany of its technology patents, including those on advanced aircraft and guided missile control. Nearly all German government agencies, research and development institutes and large companies were looted,and German scientists were forced to immigrate to the US. In the 1990s, US intelligence agencies installed eavesdropping devices in the cars of Japanese negotiators during automobile trade talks to intercept internal information and gain the upper hand in thenegotiations. In 2001, the European company Airbus sued the Americancompany Boeing for tracking Airbus employees' telephone, fax, and e-mails for business espionageusing the electronic surveillance system named Echelon developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA). In 2013, the US DOJ detained four Alstom executives to force the French company into a fire sale of its core business, power and grid, to the US company General Electric. In 2021, Danish media exposed that the US NSA wiretapped senior officials and business leaders in European countries using internet facilities located in Denmark. In addition, using ""chip shortages"" as an excuse, the US has also set deadlines to force leading chip makers from different countries to submit key information, including orders, clients and inventory, in an effort to turn the table in the chip sector. While claiming to uphold ""peace"" and ""openness"", the US has been wantonly setting up technological barriers, piecing together the so-called ""democratic technology alliance"", politicizing science and technology and turning them into ideological issues, and formingexclusive small circles. Identifyingnearly 20 categories as controlled critical technologies, including biotechnology and artificial intelligence, the US has tightenedup export control and investment scrutiny. It has also overstretchedthe concept of national security to contain and even stranglehold the development of high-tech industries in other countries, whichseverely violates the rights of developing countries in pursuing science and technology advancement. Falsehood 18: Climate is not about ideology. It's about math. If China sticks with its current plan and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the rest of the world must go to zero by 2035. And that's simply not possible. Reality Check:The US holds undeniable responsibilities for climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. It shouldn\'t shift responsibilities onto others, nor should it practice ""double standards"". Developed countries, due to their unconstrained emissions over more than two centuries of industrialization, bear undeniable historical responsibilities for climate change. From 1850 to 2011, developed countries contributed to 79 percent of global carbon emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement all require developed countries to repay their historical debts. From a historical perspective, developing countries are not the primary emitters of GHG, but the victims of climate change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance. As developed and developing countries do not bear the same historical responsibilities for climate change, and have different development needs and capabilities, it would be both inappropriate and unfair to apply the same restrictions on them. Wera Mori, Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea(PNG)said on the sidelines of COP26 that countries like PNG have become victims of climate change caused by the industrialization of developed countries and are now bearing the consequences of their actions, which is absolutely unfair. In tackling climate change, China is not just a responsible participant, but also a serious doer. President Xi Jinping committed explicitly that China will strive to peak CO2emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. That means China will move from carbon peak to neutrality in only 30 years, while the time the EU, the US and Japan give themselves is respectively 2.4, 1.4 and 1.2 times of China's. China has made notable contribution to the global efforts in energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and building, which are all in the range of 30 to 50 percent. By the end of 2020, China's CO2emissions per unit of GDP had dropped by 48.4 percent relative to the 2005 level. The proportion of coal in total energy consumption fell from 67 percent in 2005 to 56.8 percent in 2020. Thecumulativeinstalled capacity of renewable power generation exceeded 1 billion kilowatts, accounting for 43.5 percent of the national total. Chinese companies have taken 15 spots in the world's top 20 PV companies list, including all the top five spots, and seven spots in the top 10 wind power companies list. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of coal-fired power generation capacity, which is larger than the total installed power capacity of the UK. By the end of 2021, China's new energy vehicle ownership had exceeded 7.84 million units, and 2.95 million units were newly registered in 2021, accounting for 11.25 percent of all newly registered vehicles that year. The share of renewable energy in China's energy mix has already exceeded that of the US. By the end of 2019, the total installed capacity of China's hydro, wind and solar power generation had reached 756 million kilowatts, 2.8 times that of the US.Renewable energy accounts for 12.7 percent of China's primary energy consumption, approximately 1.4 times that of the US. The US is the world's largest GHG emitter in cumulative terms, and its per capita carbon emissions are 3.3 times that of the global average. In the 270 years from 1750 to 2019, the US emitted a cumulative 412.5 billion tons of GHG, accounting for about 1/4 of the global total. The US has produced the world's largest cumulative emissions, which are almost twice that of China's. Here are some statistics: the historical peak of US per capita GHG emissions was 23.44 tons; in 2018, US per capita emissions were 16.85 tons, while China's were 7.56 tons. Despite its status as a major manufacturing nation, China's current per capita carbon emissions are not even half that of the US, and its per capita cumulative emissions are only around 1/8 that of the US. Even by the time of 2030, when China's carbon emissions will have peaked, the country's per capita carbon emissions will still just be around 7-8 tons. In comparison, when the US had its carbon peak in 2005, its per capita carbon emissions had already reached 14 tons. In June 2017, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and in November 2020, it officially pulled out of the accord. Such a move seriously undermined the equity, efficiency and efficacy of global climate governance. The US had stayed outside the Paris Agreement until February 2021. Despite the improvement in political posture, the GHG emissions generated simply cannot be rolled back. Instead of cutting emissions, the US produced more emissions in 2021 than 2020, drifting further away from the course set by the Paris Agreement. With its flip-flopping on such an existential issue, the US has fully exposed its utilitarian approach to major issues of principles and lost its credibility in the family of nations. It is the unshirkable moral responsibility of developed countries to provide funding for developing countries to help them better cope with climate change. At Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancn in 2010, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing jointly 100 billion US dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. More than ten years have passed, developed countries have never truly delivered on their commitment. Report by a well-known international think tank shows that not only did developed countries fall short of their collective climate financing target every year, they also juggled the figures, providing far less funds than officially released figures. Most notably, the US only fulfilled less than 20percentof its due contribution. For years, the US has been saying publicly that it wants to work with China on climate change, but its actions say otherwise. While demanding China to consume less coal, it asks China to continue buying coal from it; while appealing for the development of renewable energies, it imposes sanctions on Chinese PV businesses. Take PV products as an example, starting from 2012, the US has imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese PV products, with rates as high as 34 to 47 percent. In December 2014, the US conducted anti-dumping and countervailing investigations on Chinese PV manufacturers. In January 2018, the previous US administration decided to slap global safeguard tariffs on 8.5 billion US dollars\' worth of solar panel imports. In late 2021, the so-called ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"" was signed into law by the US, which is yet another attempt to hobble the PV industry in Xinjiang under the disguise of human rights. Relevant US measures have not only impeded normal trade in PV products and disrupted normal supply chains, but also undermined global efforts in countering climate change. The US should correct its wrong practices in order to create an enabling environment for climate cooperation with China. Climate change has caused serious challenges to human survival and development, and must be tackled through global cooperation. Developed countries, the US included, should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and follow the requirements of the Paris Agreement. They need to face up to their historical responsibilities, and level up their ambitions and actions. They need to take the lead in making substantial reductions of emissions and strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. In the meantime, they need to give developing countries due space for development and emission, and deliver on their commitments of providing developing countries with adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support. On the basis of meeting financing pledges and leveraging public funds, efforts can be made to promote the development of green finance and bring private investment into low-carbon sectors. It is also important to build national, regional and global carbon markets and carbon pricing mechanisms, bring down the costs and raise the level of emissions reductions, promote technological innovation and sustainable development, and provide developing countries with stable sources of funding for mitigation and capacity-building through the benefit sharing mechanism of carbon markets. Falsehood 19:To counter illegal and illicit narcotics, especially synthetic opioids like fentanyl, we want to work with China to stop international drug trafficking organizations from getting precursor chemicals, many of which originate in China. Reality Check:The US has itself to blame for the root cause of fentanyl abuse in the country. Narcotics abuse, a chronic malaise plaguing the US, has deep historical and social roots. With five percent of the world's population, the US consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, making the country the world's biggest market for narcotics. There is a prevalent tradition of prescription painkiller abuse in the US, undergirded by a complete chain of pharmaceutical companies, medical representatives and doctors. All-out marketing by pharmaceutical companies, over-prescription by doctors, ineffective government crackdowns and the negative implications of marijuana legalization are among the combination of factors behind an ever-growing market for narcotics. Opioid abuse in the US and its rising toll started with OxyContin, an opioid painkiller made by Purdue Pharma and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995.When it comes to discouraging demand and curbing production, the US should have done a lot more. While the US has the most acute fentanyl challenge in the world, it is also the biggest producer and consumer of fentanyl and has yet to officially schedule fentanyl-related substancesasa class. Nevertheless, it kept demanding other countries to take actions. This is a typical example of ""forcingothers to take medicine for one\'s own illness"". The Chinese government takes a zero-tolerance approach to narcotics and strictly regulates anesthetics, psychotropic substances and their precursors. By the end of 2021, China has added 37 drug precursors and ephedrine-related substances to its control list, which became even longer than the UN list. China strictly regulates import and export of chemicals pursuant to international rules and its domestic laws, and its efforts and achievements in this regard are visible to all. On 1 May 2019, the Chinese government became the first country in the world to class schedule fentanyl-related substances, although there was no large-scale fentanyl abuse or immediate hazard in China. This is an important follow-up to the common understandings reached between the presidents of China and the US, and a concrete example of how China, keeping in mind the health, safety and well-being of humanity, actively responds to the US concern and helps it tackle its domestic opioid crisis. On 1 July 2021, China class scheduled allsynthetic cannabinoids and another 18 psychoactive substances including fluoroketamine. On 20 September of the same year, another six chemicals, including methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate (MAPA), were added as drug precursors. China is making continuous efforts to regulate precursors in accordance with law. China has taken a host of measures to crack down on the trafficking of fentanyl and other scheduled chemicals, like introducing real-name registration of senders and receivers, parcel examination and X-ray screening in the express delivery sector, andstepping up examination of cross-border parcels to certain destinations including the US. These measures have paid off. Afterclass scheduling fentanyl-related substances, China'sNational Narcotics Control Commission and Ministry of Public Security have maintainedclose, candid and in-depth coordination withtheir US counterparts including the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the State DepartmentBureau ofInternational Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs andthe Drug Enforcement Administration.Since September 2019, the US has not seized any fentanyl-related substances coming from China. The US has expressed appreciation to China on many occasions and noted drug control as a highlight in bilateral law enforcement cooperation. As is known to all, the responsibility to prevent the entry of non-scheduled chemicals and their use in illicit drug-making falls on the import country. The US, however, would neither officially schedule fentanyl nor address the issue of domestic consumption. Instead, it chose to shift the blame by falsely claiming that ""fentanyl precursors used by drug trafficking organizations originate in China"" and making an issue out of non-scheduled chemicals. This reflects an ulterior motive and an extreme lack of responsibility for the life and health of its own people. InMay 2020, without producingany evidence, the US addedtheInstituteof Forensic Science of China\'sMinistry of Public Security and the National Narcotics Laboratoryto its ""Entity List"". Such a practice of seeking China\'s cooperation on the one hand while imposing sanctions on China\'s narcotics control authorities has seriously hindered the operation of China\'s fentanyl monitoring systemand undermined the counter-narcotics cooperation between China and the US. While China and the rest of the world are tightening control over fentanyl-related substances, fentanyl-related problems are deteriorating in the US, causing a mounting death toll. It lays bare the US's failure to get to the crux of the fentanyl abuse problem. China has acted out of goodwill and repeatedly advised the US to follow effective practices widely recognized by the international community, like stepping up regulation on fentanyl prescription and promoting public awareness Falsehood 20:As a global food crisis threatens people worldwide, we look to China  a country that's achieved great things in agriculture  to help with a global response. Reality Check: The US has long been restricting grain exports and monopolizing grain trade. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US expanded its arms assistance and abused unilateral sanctions, further aggravating the global food shortage. It bears unshirkable responsibility for the global food crisis. The US-driven deglobalization, its grain-for-energy production policies and food oligopolies are the root causes of global food crisis. Using its status as a major grain-producer, the US has been restricting its grain exports to other countries, causing disruptions to normal global grain trade. The 12 major grain producers such as the US, Canada and the European Union accounts for 70percent of the world's total grain production and exportation. In global trade relations, the US and other Western countries weigh heavily on whether developing countries can buy grain and at what price. The US consumes grain to produce biofuels, straining global food supply, especially the supply of subsistence crops. Nearly one-third of the corn produced in the US is used for biofuels. Using grain as substitute for energy leads to fewer grain for global food supply, creating a vicious circle of food and energy prices pushing up each other. The four major grain suppliers ADM, Bunge and Cargilland Louis Dreyfus monopolize more than 80percent of the world's grain trade, and control global agricultural raw materials as well as grain production, processing and supply. These four grain suppliers, three from the US, manipulate the international prices of grain and earn extra profits from global food price volatility. Since 2021, their net income has increased by 53 percent, 80 percent, 64 percent and 47.7 percent respectively, and the stock prices of ADM and Bunge have nearly tripled. These international food oligopolies are profit-seeking, and they won't miss any opportunity to stir up food security issues and inflate food supply shortage to make bigger profits. The US has been stoking the flames in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and abusing economic sanctions. These have exacerbated global food shortage. The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a direct consequence of the constant instigation by the US and other Western countries. US military and arms assistance to Ukraine has increased to 53.6 billion US dollars, more than 70 percent of the combined military spending of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The longer and bigger the conflict is, the greater its impact on global food production and supply will be, and the food crisis will further intensify. In the face of a global food crisis, major grain-producing countries such as the US have instead kept their ""grain bags"" tight. According to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report released by the US Department of Agriculture this May, US wheat exports in 2021/22 will be 18.9 percent lower than the previous year. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the total amount of food exports affected by the restrictions has increased significantly, which now represents about 17 percent of total calories traded in the world The US food security initiative is more of empty words than concrete actions, only to fragment global food security governance. Russia is a major exporter of subsistence crops and the world's largest exporter of fertilizers. Since the US and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, the price index of various fertilizers has risen by more than 30 percent, which has seriously affected agricultural production. From 2021 to 2022, wheat and barley exports from Russia account for 16 percent and 12.9 percent of the world's total respectively. Statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) show that since the US imposed sanctions on Russia, the Food Price Index in May this year has risen by 14 percent compared with February. Serious food waste in the US has worsened the global food shortage. First, the amount of food waste is astounding. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the US, 30 to 40 percent of the food supply and 38 percent of grain products are never eaten each year. In 2018, the US had 103 million tons of its food wasted, worth 161 billion US dollars. In 2020, the country's food waste per capita was 59 kilograms. Second, distribution is uneven. About 38 million people are food insecure in the US in 2020, and the majority of them are African Americans, Latin Americans and Native Americans. According to National Geographic, more than one-third of the low-income households do not have access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program introduced by the US government, and its benefits fall short of helping many families in high-cost areas enjoy a healthy and adequate diet. Third, secondary problems are prominent. Every year, the overproduction of food in the US puts a staggering burden on the environment and wastes numerous resources, including over 9.3 million hectares of arable land, 22 trillion liters of water, 350 million kilograms of pesticides, and 6.35 million tons of chemical fertilizers. China has made significant contributions to global food security. It has supported one-fifth of the world's population with a quarter of the world's total food, on less than 9 percent of the world's arable land. The Global Development Initiative put forward by China has identified food security as one of the eight priority areas of cooperation. China will mobilize efforts from all parties across the globe to draw on each other's strength, and form the greatest synergy to meet all sustainable development goals including food security. This initiative has received positive response from more than 100 countries around the world and international organizations such as the UN. The Chinese people cherish food and keep to the traditional virtue of thrift. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to food security. He has called for thriftiness and opposes squandering, stressing on multiple occasions the need to stop food waste. Since the launch of the nationwide ""Clear Your Plate"" campaign in 2013, consumer food waste in China has been significantly reduced. According to the Nature magazine, the amount of food discarded by Chinese restaurants and eateries has decreased by 40 percent. In 2021, the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste hosted by China was well received by the international community, including members of the G20. China is an important strategic partner of FAO in South-South cooperation. In recent years, China has donated 130 million US dollars to the FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund. China has sent more than 1,100 agricultural experts and technical personnel to and trained nearly 100,000 farmers in more than 40 countries and regions. Under the framework of the FAO's South-South Cooperation Programme, China has donated the largest amount of fund, sent the most experts, and undertaken the most projects among all developing countries. China has provided its own solutions to global food shortage. Chinese hybrid rice is being grown in dozens of countries and regions in Asia, Africa and the Americas, with an annual growth area of eight million hectares. This increased the world\'s total grain output by 150 million tons, enough to feed 400 to 500 million more people. Yuan Longping, known as the ""Father of Chinese Hybrid Rice"", and other Chinese researchers have offered advice and counsel in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and many other countries. Through international training courses, China has trained over 14,000 hybrid rice technicians for more than 80 developing countries. Falsehood 21:Beijing has perfected mass surveillance and exported that technology to more than 80 countries. Reality Check:The US is the biggest empire of hacking. The use of video surveillanceand big data technology is an important step taken by the Chinese government to improve social governance, and also a common practice across the world. It is necessary, legal and justified. Tianwang (Skynet), which iscomposed of video surveillance systems,effectively eliminates potential risks to public security and ensuresthe high percentage of solved criminal cases in China. With the increasingly digitized crime prevention and control system, 98.6 percent of the people in Chinafelt safe in 2021, and China is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China ranked the thirdin the law and order index published by Gallup, aUS consulting company, while the US 36th. Statisticsshow that there were some 70 million cameras installed in the US in 2018, one for every 4.6 people.For the USto accuseChina of mass surveillance, it's just double standard at work. For a long time, the US has carried out large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber espionage, surveillance and attacks on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals in violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. In June 2013, the Guardian and the Washington Post reported that NSA has been running PRISM,a clandestine electronic surveillance program, since 2007, whose targets includeeven itsown allies. Der Spiegel reported that the US intelligence may have been monitoring the German Chancellor's mobile phone communications for nearly a decade. In 2020, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC)demanded Facebook to stop sending data of EU users to the US. The report comes just a few months after the European Court of Justice ruled the data transfer standard between the EU and the US doesn't adequately protect European citizen's privacyand concluded that EU citizens had no effective way to challenge US government surveillance. It is reported that US agencies such as NSA can theoretically ask internet companies like Facebook and Google to hand over data on an EU citizen and that EU citizen would be none-the-wiser. In December 2020, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Liberts (CNIL)of Francestated that google.fr and amazon.fr websites violated relevant French regulations by placing tracking cookies on their users' computers without obtaining prior consent and without providing adequate information. In 2021, Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) reported that between 2012 and 2014, NSA used information cables of Denmark to wiretap (spy on) senior officials of Sweden, Norway, France and Germany, including manypolitical dignitaries such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The US apparently broke its promise that it would stop wiretappingMerkel. The US abusesits leading position in internet and communication technologyandis truly an empire of hacking, tapping and theft of secrets. From PRISM, the Irritant Horn project, and Stellar Wind, to Operation Telescreen, the Hive platform and the QUANTUM attack system, the US has violated the freedom of communication and speechof its citizens through digital surveillance, and has engaged in cyber attacks, surveillance and thefts of secrets across the world. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden ofthe Stateroomprogram show that the US has covertly installed eavesdropping devices in nearly 100 of its embassies and consulates to steal secrets from their hostcountries. A report on APT-C-39released by Chinese cybersecurity company 360in 2020 reveals that APT-C-39, a hacking group under the CIA,has conducted cyberinfiltration attacks on China for 11 years targeting critical sectors includingaviation and aerospace, research institutions, oil industry, large internet companies, and government agencies. Such attacks have seriously undermined China's national securityandthe security of its economy, critical infrastructureas well aspersonal information of the general public. According to areport on the indiscriminate worldwide cyber attacks by NSA's APT-C-40 over the past decadereleased by 360 in 2022, NSA has attacked, usingcyber weapons,403 targets in 47 countries and regions worldwide, including China, the UK, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, India, the ROK, the UAE, South Africa and Brazil. On 19 April 2022, China\'s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) issued an alert on cyber attacks by the US government against other countries and released a related report. Itbrings to light ""Hive"", a lightweight cyber weapon used exclusively by the US government, and the fact that the US has deployed cyber attack platforms worldwide and has jumper servers and VPN channels in countries like France, Germany, Canada, Turkey and Malaysia.",[],[],2022-06-19 19:40,fmprc.gov.cn,"This is not a news article or an academic text, but rather a long, inflammatory post from 2017 (not specified exactly when it was posted) that appears to be part of a series of articles critical of China. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Claimed purpose:** The author claims to have obtained leaked documents and information about Chinese government activities, including mass surveillance, hacking, and cyber attacks.

**Arguments:**

1. **Unfounded allegations:** The author accuses China of numerous abuses of power, including:
	* Mass surveillance using video cameras (Tianwang)
	* Widespread hacking and data theft
	* Use of the US's own technology to spy on foreign governments and citizens
2. **Inconsistencies and lack of evidence:** The author criticizes the US for allegedly violating international law, ignoring Chinese sovereignty, and engaging in cyber attacks that undermine China's national security.
3. **Examples:**
	* The NSA is accused of conducting secret surveillance on foreign leaders and citizens through PRISM
	* Facebook is alleged to have been hacked by the US government (although this claim has not been independently verified)
	* China allegedly deployed cyber attack platforms worldwide
4. **Contrasting views:** The author argues that these allegations demonstrate a double standard, with the US accusing China of similar abuses but denying any wrongdoing itself.

**Key points:**

1. **Lack of concrete evidence:** The author claims to have obtained leaked documents and information, but does not provide specific details or sources.
2. **Inconsistent narratives:** The content is riddled with inconsistencies and unsubstantiated accusations.
3. **Sensationalism and bias:** The author appears to be using emotive language to attract attention, rather than providing a balanced analysis of the facts.

**Criticisms:**

1. **Lack of academic rigor:** This text does not provide peer-reviewed evidence or references to support its claims.
2. **Biased presentation:** The author's tone and language are sensationalized and biased towards portraying China in a negative light.
3. **Potential for spread of misinformation:** This post may be intended to promote conspiracy theories rather than inform readers about the actual facts.

Overall, this text appears to be an unverified, inflammatory piece that should not be taken seriously as credible information on Chinese government activities or actions.","The article discusses several aspects of China's alleged mass surveillance program, which is often referred to as ""Beijing's perfect mass surveillance"" or ""Chinese Big Brother."" Here are some key points:

1. **Mass surveillance is a reality**: The author notes that the Chinese government has been collecting and analyzing vast amounts of personal data through various means, including:
	* Video surveillance (Tianwang)
	* Big data technology
	* Social media monitoring
	* Phone records analysis
2. **Not just a domestic issue**: China's mass surveillance is not limited to its own borders; it's also being exported to other countries.
3. **Hacking and cyber attacks are involved**: The article mentions various examples of Chinese hacking groups, including the Stateroom program and APT-C-39, which have been responsible for cyberinfiltration attacks on China and other countries.
4. **International cooperation is needed**: Some argue that international cooperation could help prevent mass surveillance from spreading to other countries.
5. **China's ""digital governance"" approach**: The author suggests that the Chinese government's approach to digital governance may be an example of a successful model, with some similarities to China's National Information Safety Technology Development Plan (NIITDP).

However, there are also concerns and criticisms about China's mass surveillance program:

1. **Lack of transparency**: There is limited information available on how much data the Chinese government is collecting and what methods it uses.
2. **Human rights implications**: Some human rights groups have raised concerns that China's mass surveillance program may be used to suppress dissent and restrict individual freedoms.
3. **National security risks**: The article suggests that China's mass surveillance program could also pose national security risks, as it could be used to gather sensitive information about other countries.

Overall, the topic of China's mass surveillance is complex and multifaceted, with various perspectives and concerns. While some aspects may suggest a successful model for digital governance, others raise serious human rights and national security implications.

It's worth noting that the article also mentions falsehoods 21:

1. **Beijing has perfected mass surveillance**: This statement is likely meant to be ironic or sarcastic, as China has not been widely recognized for its advanced intelligence capabilities.
2. **US hacking is a common practice**: While it's true that some US companies have engaged in cyber attacks and data breaches, the article suggests that this is not unique to the US and should be taken with caution.

As for falsehood 21: Beijing has perfected mass surveillance, I would categorize this statement as false or misleading. There are several reasons why:

1. **China's surveillance efforts are largely focused on domestic security**: While China has been expanding its surveillance capabilities in recent years, it is still primarily focused on domestic security and suppressing dissent rather than gathering data for external purposes.
2. **The Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged the scope of its mass surveillance program**: There is no indication that the Chinese government has made a public statement about the scale or purpose of its mass surveillance program.

Overall, I would conclude that falsehood 21: Beijing has perfected mass surveillance is false or misleading and should be taken with caution."

The move, which the EU described as an effort to maintain ""fair competition"", thinly veils an underlying attempt to curb China\'s ascendancy in the EV industry. China's EV ecosystem is not only vast, it is also driven by advanced battery technology, extensive infrastructure and a government committed to environmental progress. Chinese EV companies have achieved scale, reduced costs and boosted production efficiency, delivering high-quality products at a fraction of the cost compared with Western competitors. China has taken a leading role in the EV market, reaching milestones that put it far ahead of other countries. In 2023, China accounted for more than half of the world's EV sales, with 8 million vehicles sold globally. Chinese EV brands, such as BYD, NIO and Xpeng, are seen as champions of cost-effective, eco-friendly alternatives. The secret to China's success in this sector lies in its approach to scaling battery manufacturing, a critical component in EV production. Battery packs can represent up to 40 percent of an EV's total cost, so China's ability to reduce this cost has been instrumental in making its EVs affordable. Additionally, China's EV market is backed by some of the world's largest battery manufacturers like Contemporary Amperex Technology. Currently, China supplies over 70 percent of the world's lithiumion batteries used in EVs. Over the past decade, China has invested in extensive charging infrastructure, with nearly 8.6 million public charging stations as of the end of 2023. This infrastructure not only aids current EV users but also makes EVs a more attractive choice for potential buyers. At the policy level, China's new energy vehicle mandate has been instrumental in driving innovation. The NEV policy encourages car manufacturers to produce electric and hybrid vehicles, establishing quotas that push the industry toward greener alternatives. Moreover, this sector's growth aligns with China's ambitious commitment to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Western auto manufacturers and policymakers frequently argue that China's rapid advancement in EVs is a result of unfair subsidies. However, this overlooks the larger issue: Chinese companies have successfully innovated and achieved production efficiencies that allow them to deliver high-quality EVs at accessible prices. The perceived threat to Western markets is not merely about competition but about China's competitive edge in technology. Chinese EVs offer longer battery life, shorter charging times and superior mileage compared with many Western models  at a fraction of the cost. By reducing costs, China has democratized access to clean transportation. The West\'s protectionist stance, however, may slow this progress, indicating that the tariffs are more about staving off Chinese competition than about actual ""fair play"" in the market. Beyond its borders, Chinese companies actively collaborate with international partners, contributing to the spread of EV infrastructure and technology across the developing world. By making clean transportation affordable, China enables nations with limited resources to participate in the green transition, helping combat climate change on a global scale. The environmental implications of this leadership are monumental. China's focus on clean energy vehicles has prevented millions of tons of CO2 emissions. Each Chinese EV on the road contributes to a broader goal of global carbon reduction. China's ability to produce affordable EVs aligns with the international community's interest in clean transportation. China's EV industry is a testament to how strategic investments, technological innovations and visionary policies can transform a sector. The West's response reveals not a commitment to fair competition but rather a protectionist maneuver that threatens to undermine the global green transition. It is time for the West to recognize that China's EV industry is not a threat but an opportunity for a cleaner, greener world.

82,SCO and health diplomacy beyond borders,"('Pakistan', 'Islamabad')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\14\WS670c8aeba310f1265a1c7725.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/14/WS670c8aeba310f1265a1c7725.html,"The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has established itself as one of the most important regional organizations, with a wide-reaching influence that spans multiple sectors, including security, trade, energy and cultural cooperation. Although the organization's primary focus has historically been on security and counter-terrorism, it has increasingly broadened its scope to encompass issues that transcend borders, including economic integration, technological innovation and more recently, health diplomacy. Health diplomacy within the SCO is becoming a crucial area of cooperation as global health challenges intensify. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of cross-border collaboration in the health sector, from the development and distribution of vaccines to ensuring the resilience of healthcare systems. SCO member states are not immune to these challenges, with many facing the dual burden of existing healthcare infrastructure gaps and the pressing need to modernize healthcare delivery through innovation in medical technology. The upcoming 23rd Meeting of the Council of Heads of Government of the SCO in Islamabad is set to be a pivotal moment for advancing health diplomacy within the organization. This meeting, which will take place from October 14 to 17, 2024, will be attended by heads of government from across the region, including Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who is visiting Pakistan at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The significance of this high-level visit cannot be understated. It reflects the strengthening ties between SCO members, particularly Pakistan and China, and opens the door for deeper cooperation in areas like healthcare, which have traditionally been overlooked in favor of more immediate security concerns. For Pakistan, hosting this meeting is an opportunity of immense strategic and economic importance. As a member of the SCO, Pakistan has actively participated in regional security and trade initiatives, but its healthcare system has yet to fully benefit from the potential offered by this regional partnership. With the upcoming meeting held in Islamabad, Pakistan is uniquely positioned to advocate for greater collaboration in health diplomacy. The country's healthcare system must contend with issues ranging from inadequate facilities in rural areas to a shortage of healthcare professionals. Moreover, Pakistan has the potential to become a regional hub for healthcare cooperation, given its strategic location and growing influence within the SCO. Pakistan has the chance to push for concrete initiatives in healthcare. For instance, Pakistan could advocate for the creation of a regional health task force within the SCO, aimed at coordinating responses to health emergencies, sharing best practices in public health, and ensuring the equitable distribution of medical supplies and vaccines. Such an initiative could be modeled after successful global health alliances but tailored to the unique needs and capacities of SCO member states. The potential for collaboration extends beyond just government-to-government relations. Private sector partnerships within the SCO can also play a critical role in advancing healthcare objectives. Pakistan's burgeoning technology sector, combined with the expertise of other SCO members in medical research and development, presents an opportunity for joint ventures in medical technology. These collaborations could lead to the development of new healthcare innovations that not only benefit SCO countries but also have the potential for global impact. Additionally, the growing focus on vaccine research within the SCO offers Pakistan a platform to collaborate on vaccine development and distribution, ensuring that the region is better prepared for future pandemics. The presence of heads of government, particularly China's Premier Li Qiang, at the meeting in Islamabad further highlights the importance of these discussions. China has been a leader in health diplomacy, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it played a key role in vaccine development and distribution across the globe, including to SCO countries. By strengthening ties with China and other member states, Pakistan stands to gain from these advancements in healthcare. The SCO's focus on health diplomacy presents a unique opportunity for Pakistan to tap into regional resources and expertise to improve its healthcare system, enhance its capacity for dealing with health crises and position itself as a leader in regional health cooperation. For Pakistan, the upcoming meeting represents more than just an opportunity to host world leadersit is a chance to shape the future of health diplomacy within the SCO and beyond. Through partnerships, innovation and collaboration, the SCO can lead the way in addressing global health challenges, with Pakistan playing a central role in this evolving dynamic. The 23rd Meeting of the Council of Heads of Government in Islamabad could mark a turning point in how the SCO approaches healthcare, with potential for long-term benefits not only for Pakistan but for the entire region.

The SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability as it promotes the development and prosperity of all countries. The SCO member states, as reflected in the consensus they reached at the SCO Astana summit in July, are committed to jointly building a common home featuring solidarity and mutual trust, peace and tranquility, prosperity and development, good-neighborliness and friendship, as well as fairness and justice. To build such a common home, a more solid political foundation, more reliable security guarantees, closer economic ties, deeper emotional bond and more coordinated multilateral cooperation are needed, as Premier Li urged. To that end, China stands ready to work with all parties to translate the consensus reached by the heads of state into effective actions and turn the aforementioned vision of building a common home into reality. The SCO member states should strengthen their strategic alignment based on missions and tasks, formulate the SCO's development strategy for the next decade, draw a roadmap for cooperation in various fields, strengthen strategic communication, eliminate differences and enhance mutual trust through dialogue. They should expand practical cooperation in line with the development needs of the SCO region, particularly in such fields as poverty reduction, digital economy and green development, so as to better facilitate regional trade and investment, enhance connectivity and maintain stable and unimpeded industry and supply chains. They also need to focus on major risks and actively respond to them. The SCO member states should step up joint actions to combat extremist, separatist and terrorist forces, and accelerate the building of a universal center to address the challenges and threats to the security of SCO member states. They should always expand people-to-people exchanges in response to public expectations. As Premier Li said, SCO member states should give full play to the SCO Committee on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, build the SCO digital education alliance, and organize events under signature programs such as the Forum on People-to-People Friendship. In the face of the complex and volatile international environment and changes unseen in a century, all parties need to actively implement the outcomes of the Astana summit, work closely in solidarity and coordination, and strengthen the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union.

At the payloads handover ceremony held by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) in Beijing on Thursday, the CNSA and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation signed payload delivery certificates with domestic and international users, including those from Thailand and Pakistan. Bian Zhigang, deputy head of CNSA, said the Shijian-19 mission fully leverages the advantages of the new generation retrievable space experiment platform, conducting space breeding experiments of about 1,000 species of germplasm resources, providing crucial support for the innovation of germplasm resources in China. The mission has also offered a valuable in-orbit validation opportunity for domestically produced components and raw materials. According to Meng Lingjie, director of the Earth Observation System and Data Center under the CNSA, the Shijian-19 mission has made a breakthrough in its recovery module. The satellite platform can be reused more than 10 times, significantly reducing manufacturing costs and improving operational efficiency. The satellite serves as a space testing platform that enables convenient transportation of payloads between Earth and space, offering high-quality experimental services, said Meng, adding that it has wide-ranging applications in space sci-tech experiments such as space breeding as well as space pharmaceutical and material manufacturing. The satellite carried 500 kg of experiment payloads back to Earth, greatly enhancing the capability for payload recovery, according to Meng. It can also provide a high-quality microgravity environment for experiments. When the satellite was in orbit, seven new technology experiments were carried out, including microgravity hydrogen production, low-frequency magnetic communications, inflatable sealed cabin and wireless power transmission. The satellite also carried nine space science payloads to conduct research in fields such as carbon nanomaterials and devices, solid catalyst materials, and oral and dental science materials. According to Liu Luxiang, executive director general of the Institute of Crop Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Shijian-19 mission carried seeds of about 1,800 plant materials and more than 1,000 species of microorganisms, encompassing nearly all major kinds of agricultural products. The mission not only provides solid support to China's space breeding, but also creates a collaboration platform for international counterparts, said Liu, who is also the chief scientist of China's space breeding project. The satellite carried rice seeds from Thailand, seeds of wheat, rice, corn and beans from Pakistan, as well as crop seeds from other countries. ""In face of the challenge of global food security, it is necessary to continuously enhance food production, develop new genetic resources that promote nutrition and health, and cultivate new grain varieties that are more resilient to climate change with improved stress tolerance,"" Liu said. Over the past 30 years, China has developed over 300 crop varieties through its space breeding technologies. These varieties cover an annual cultivation area of about 2 million hectares, with remarkable social and economic benefits, according to Liu.

The rhetoric can be amusing. On the one hand, the opponents want to propagate the idea that China is on the decline, the economy is in a mess, and the people are not satisfied with the government and the Communist Party of China's performance. At the same time, they also want us to believe that China's meteoric rise is threatening the world, especially the West. This calls for analyzing the facts to find the truth about China. Let's start with future drivers of growth and development. There is unanimous global acceptance of the fact that future growth drivers will be shaped by the power of innovation, technology development, and competence in compound computing, space technology and artificial intelligence. Data show that China is a leading player in all the above areas, and a leader in some of them. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said that China has become a leader in 37 of 44 critical technologies. The country is moving quickly and acquiring the capability to become the hub and superpower in technology. China leads in investments in new energy. For example, in 2023, China was the world's largest investor in clean energy technologies, production and consumption, and was also the biggest supplier of wind turbines and solar panels in the global market. However, China faces many obstacles in the chip and semiconductor segments. Western countries have gone all out to prevent Chinese companies from building their capacity in these areas. It is good to note that China has put in place numerous instruments to overcome these challenges. China is aware that the drive for innovation and technology development will not be sustainable without investment in education and the creation of high-quality human capital. Thus, China is investing heavily in these areas. China already has the biggest pool of STEM graduates, and the number could be double that of the United States by 2025. The country has also invested much in building capacity and resilience to fight against future challenges such as climate change, pandemics and technology-related hurdles. It displayed its resilience and spirit in fighting back the COVID-19 pandemic. It put in place instruments to counter and control the pandemic in no time, and assisted the rest of the world in combating the challenge with medical supplies and special teams. In promotion of green agriculture and the food industry, China has achieved many milestones. It has significantly reduced usage of nitrogen fertilizers and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts have contributed to environmental protection, better and healthier food availability, and preservation of soil fertility. China has also launched a plan to develop modern protected agriculture in the 2023-30 period. It has built the most sophisticated soft and hard infrastructure to address the challenges of new technologies and cyberspace. China knows that the best way to survive and thrive in a global village is to go for win-win cooperation and build partnerships, and that confrontation, decoupling, undermining others, or winning at the cost of others are not the ways forward. Thus it has built partnerships and forums, such as the Boao Forum for Asia, Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, and the China-ASEAN cooperation mechanism. Besides, China has launched and steered the Belt and Road Initiative, the biggest economic and connectivity program in human history. The latest statistics show that more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations have signed BRI cooperation agreements with China. The China International Import Expo is helping the country to strengthen its role in the global supply and value chains. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has established itself as a formidable global financial player. It can be inferred that China has built the capacity and capabilities to enjoy early advantages from future growth and development drivers under the sound leadership of the CPC Central Committee. It has also established itself as a leader in new growth drivers, and the world is looking toward China to benefit from its development. It is certain that China can tackle future challenges like climate change, technology and pandemics in a better way, and offer other countries the opportunity to benefit from its development and prosperity without them compromising on their dignity and sovereignty. Therefore, China is neither on the decline nor a threat to the world but is instead a vital key to human progress.

Bolstered by governmental backing, the nation emerged as the world's third-largest market for solar additions in 2023, after China and the US, according to research provider BloombergNEF. Meanwhile, China flaunts a formidable industrial infrastructure, wielding technical prowess and cost efficiencies in the production of photovoltaic equipment. A growing number of Chinese solar firms are also exploring varied avenues for international cooperation, be it through offshore manufacturing facilities or technology licensing agreements. This may echo Brazil's drive to nurture domestic solar equipment manufacturing, fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem, experts said. ""China and Brazil complement each other in renewable energy development, with Brazil rich in new energy resources and China leading globally in wind, solar and electric vehicle production. Cooperation between China and Brazil in renewable energy will create a win-win situation, offering significant room for future collaboration,"" said Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University. ""Enhanced cooperation between the two countries in renewable energy will help break barriers to capital and technology flow, making a remarkable contribution to global energy transition,"" he added. Global cooperation is paramount in achieving shared climate goals. Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, said in a recent interview with China Daily that the world is not on track to achieve the goal of tripling the installed capacity of renewable energy by 2030, a goal set at the 2023 COP28 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai, while tripling renewables is essential to cut emissions and keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C within reach. He said China is spearheading the global transition toward sustainable practices by providing affordable solar panels and wind turbines, promoting electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. According to China's National Energy Administration, over the past decade, average power costs per kilowatt-hour of wind and solar power projects in China have fallen by over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. Globally, the country has to date contributed over 80 percent of photovoltaic modules and 70 percent of wind power equipment. Its products have been exported to over 200 countries and regions. In the first half, Brazil became the third-largest market for Chinese photovoltaic module exports, accounting for 8.8 percent of total exports, closely following Pakistan at 8.9 percent, according to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association.

Proposed by China but Belonging to the Whole World II. Paving the Way Towards Shared Development and Prosperity III. Promoting All-Round Connectivity in Multiple Fields IV. Injecting Positive Energy into World Peace and Development V. Pursuing Steady and Sustained Progress in High-Quality BRI Cooperation Conclusion Preamble Over two millennia ago, inspired by a sincere wish for friendship, our ancestors travelled across grasslands and deserts to create a land Silk Road connecting Asia, Europe and Africa, leading the world into an era of extensive cultural exchanges. More than 1,000 years ago, our ancestors set sail and braved the waves to open a maritime Silk Road linking the East and the West, beginning a new phase of closer communication among peoples. Spanning thousands of miles and years, the ancient silk routes were not only routes for trade but also roads for cultural exchanges. They made a great contribution to human progress. In the 1980s, the United Nations and some countries began to envisage the Eurasian Land Bridge, the Silk Road Initiative, and other plans, reflecting a common wish to engage in communication and cooperation. In March 2013, President Xi Jinping proposed the vision of a global community of shared future; in September and October that year, he raised the initiatives of joining with others to build a Silk Road Economic Belt and a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI). The Belt and Road Initiative is a creative development that takes on and carries forward the spirit of the ancient silk routes  two of the great achievements in human history and civilization. It enriches the ancient spirit with the zeitgeist and culture of the new era, and provides a platform for building a global community of shared future. Since its launch 10 years ago, thanks to the combined efforts of all parties, cooperation under the BRI framework has expanded beyond the borders of China to become an international effort. It has evolved from ideas into actions, from a vision into reality, and from a general framework into concrete projects. It has been welcomed by the international community both as a public good and a cooperation platform, and has achieved solid results. Over the past decade, BRI cooperation has delivered real gains to participating countries. It has contributed to the sound development of economic globalization and helped to resolve global development challenges and improve the global governance system. It has also opened up a new path for all humanity to realize modernization, and ensured that the efforts of building a global community of shared future are delivering real results. The Chinese government is publishing this white paper to present the achievements of the BRI during the past 10 years. It will give the international community a better understanding of the value of the initiative, facilitate high-quality cooperation under it, and ultimately deliver benefits to more countries and peoples. I. Proposed by China but Belonging to the Whole World The world today is going through profound change on a scale unseen in a century. Problems and challenges continue to threaten the progress of human civilization. In response to a changing global situation and the expectations of the international community, and with the future and overall interests of humanity in mind, China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Committed to the Silk Road spirit, a great heritage of human civilization, the BRI connects the past, the present, and the future. This initiative was launched by China, but it belongs to the world and benefits the whole of humanity. 1. Rooted in history, the BRI carries forward the Silk Road spirit At around 140 BC during China's Han Dynasty, Zhang Qian, a royal emissary, made a journey to the West from Chang'an (present-day Xi'an in Shaanxi Province), opening an overland route linking the East and the West. Centuries later, in the years of the Tang, Song and Yuan dynasties, silk routes boomed both over land and at sea, facilitating trade between the East and the West. In the early 15th century, Zheng He, the famous Chinese navigator of the Ming Dynasty, made seven voyages to the Western Seas, which boosted trade along the maritime silk routes. For thousands of years the ancient silk routes served as major arteries of interaction, spanning the valleys of the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus and Ganges, and the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. They connected the birthplaces of the Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian and Chinese civilizations, the lands of the believers of Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, and the homes of peoples of different nationalities and races. These routes increased connectivity among countries on the Eurasian continent, facilitated exchanges and mutual learning between Eastern and Western civilizations, boosted regional development and prosperity, and shaped the Silk Road spirit characterized by peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit. Symbolizing communication and cooperation between the East and the West, the millennia-old silk routes demonstrated that by upholding solidarity and mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit, inclusiveness and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation, countries of different ethnic groups, beliefs and cultural backgrounds could share peace and achieve development together. The Silk Road spirit is consistent with the ideal of ""all states joining together in harmony and peace"" long upheld by the Chinese nation, with the Chinese people\'s principles of amity, good neighborliness and ""helping others to succeed while seeking our own success"", and with the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. The Communist Party of China is a major political party with a global vision, and China is a major country pursuing peaceful development. The BRI, which carries forward the Silk Road spirit in the new era, evokes the pleasant memories of the past and has fired many countries' enthusiasm for connectivity. The BRI pays respect to history and tries to recreate the bustling scenes of untiring envoys and businessmen over land and countless ships calling at ports along the ancient silk routes. It is also navigating a way to the future by drawing wisdom and strength from the ancient silk routes and the Silk Road spirit. Enlightened by history, we will continue to move forward and integrate the Chinese Dream with the world's dreams, in order to realize the aspiration of all peoples for exchanges between civilizations, peace and tranquility, common development, and better lives. 2. In response to reality, the BRI resolves problems in development Development holds the master key to solving all problems. Economic globalization has given strong momentum to the world economy. Over 500 years ago, after the ancient silk routes had been interrupted for more than a half century, the Age of Discovery arrived, fundamentally changing the course of human society. Since the advent of modern times, technological revolutions and development of the productive forces have made economic globalization a surging historical trend. In particular, since the 1990s, the rapid advance of economic globalization has greatly facilitated trade, investment, flows of people, and technological progress, making an important contribution to the progress of human society. However, the economic globalization dominated by a few countries has not contributed to the common development that delivers benefits to all. Instead, it has widened the wealth gap between rich and poor, between developed and developing countries, and within developed countries. Many developing countries have benefited little from economic globalization and even lost their capacity for independent development, making it hard for them to access the track of modernization. Certain countries have practiced unilateralism, protectionism and hegemonism, hampering economic globalization and threatening a global economic recession. It is imperative to address such global problems as sluggish economic growth, shortcomings in economic governance, and imbalanced economic development. It is no longer acceptable that only a few countries dominate world economic development, control economic rules, and enjoy development fruits. The BRI targets development not only for China but for the world at large. Economic globalization remains an irreversible trend. It is unthinkable for countries to return to a state of seclusion or isolation. However, economic globalization must undergo adjustments in both form and substance. It should be made more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. China has not only benefited from economic globalization but also contributed to it. As an active participant in economic globalization, China has achieved rapid economic growth through positive interactions with the rest of the world and explored a unique path towards modernization, expanding the options for other developing countries to achieve modernization. China's rapid economic growth and steady progress in reform and opening up has provided a strong driving force for global economic stability and growth as well as an open world economy. China has been a firm advocate and defender of economic globalization. The BRI dovetails with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in concept, measures and goals. A major step taken by China, the BRI aims to promote higher-quality development through higher-standard opening up, and share China's development opportunities with the rest of the world. The BRI is also a Chinese solution to global development issues, which aims to advance modernization in participating countries in tandem, make economic globalization more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable, and ensure that more of the fruits will be shared more equitably by people across the world. 3. Oriented towards the future, the BRI creates a better world Today, the world is moving ever closer towards greater multipolarity, economic globalization, and cultural diversity, and becoming increasingly information-orientated in the process. Countries are more frequently connected and closely interdependent than at any time in the past. It is increasingly clear that humanity is a community of shared future in which everyone's interests are inseparably entwined. However, a growing deficit in peace, development, security and governance, together with interwinding conventional and non-conventional security issues such as regional conflicts, arms races, food security, terrorism, cyber-attacks, climate change, energy crises, major infectious diseases, and artificial intelligence problems, poses a grave threat to the beautiful planet on which all humans live. In the face of emerging global difficulties and challenges, human society needs new ideas, new concepts, and a more just, equitable, balanced, resilient and effective global governance system. What kind of world to build and which way to take to create a brighter future are issues that have a bearing on every country and every person. We must respond to the challenges presented by the times and make the right historic choice. As a major developing country that meets its responsibilities, China keeps in mind the future and the common interests of humanity. China has therefore proposed building a global community of shared future, with the goal of creating an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, charting a bright future for human development. The ultimate goal of the BRI is to help build a global community of shared future. As an important public good for improving global governance, the initiative provides a platform for turning the vision into reality. The BRI involves countries in different regions, at different development stages, and with different cultures. It transcends differences in ideologies and social systems. It enables different countries to share opportunities, realize common development and prosperity, and build a community of shared interests, responsibility and destiny characterized by mutual political trust, economic integration and cultural inclusiveness. As a practical means of building a global community of shared future, the BRI has created new understanding and inspired the imagination of the world, and contributed new ideas and new approaches to international exchanges. It will produce a fairer and more equitable global governance system, and take humanity to a better future. II. Paving the Way Towards Shared Development and Prosperity The BRI is in alignment with the concept of a global community of shared future. It promotes and puts into action ideas that are relevant to the present era, the world, development, security, openness, cooperation, civilization, and governance. It provides not only a conceptual framework but also a practical roadmap for all nations to achieve shared development and prosperity. 1. Principles: extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits The BRI is founded on the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. It advocates win-win cooperation in pursuit of the greater good and shared interests. It emphasizes that all countries are equal participants, contributors and beneficiaries, and encourages economic integration, interconnected development, and the sharing of achievements. The principle of extensive consultation signifies that the BRI is not a solo endeavor by China, but a collaborative effort involving all stakeholders. This principle promotes and activates authentic multilateralism, encouraging collective decision-making while fully respecting the varying levels of development, economic structures, legal systems, and cultural traditions of different nations. It emphasizes equal participation, effective communication, collective wisdom, freedom from any political or economic preconditions, and voluntary engagement to foster maximum consensus. Irrespective of size, strength and wealth, all countries participate on an equal footing and can provide opinions and proposals in bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Under this principle, economies at different stages of development will reinforce bilateral or multilateral communication, jointly identify and establish innovative cooperation mechanisms, and provide a platform for dialogue, cooperation and participation in global governance. The principle of joint contribution highlights that the BRI is not one of China's international aid programs or geopolitical tool, but a collaborative effort for shared development. It aims to align with existing regional mechanisms rather than becoming their substitute and leverage complementary strengths. This principle emphasizes the participation of all parties involved, substantial coordination with the development strategies of relevant countries and regions, and the identification and utilization of their respective development potential and comparative strengths. The objective is to collectively create new opportunities, driving forces, and development space while achieving complementary and interactive growth by capitalizing on each party's strengths and capabilities. To promote extensive participation, this principle encourages countries and businesses to engage through various forms such as bilateral cooperation, third-party market cooperation and multilateral cooperation, thereby creating synergy for development. This principle values market forces and promotes market-oriented operations to further the interests and meet the expectations of all parties involved. In this context, businesses play a central role as the main actors, while the government's responsibility lies in building platforms, establishing mechanisms, and providing policy guidance. China's key role in BRI cooperation stems from its economic size, market scale, experience in infrastructure construction, capacity to produce low-cost, high-quality, high-performance equipment, and comprehensive strengths in industry, capital, technology, talent and management. The principle of shared benefits underscores the importance of win-win cooperation. It aims to identify common interests and grounds for cooperation, meet the development needs of all parties, and address the real concerns of the people. This principle emphasizes sharing development opportunities and outcomes among all participating countries, ensuring that none of them is left behind. Most participants are developing countries, all seeking to leverage collective strengths to address challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, lagging industrial development, limited industrialization, insufficient capital and technology, and a shortage of skilled workers, to promote their own economic and social development. Under the BRI framework, China pursues the greater good and shared interests, with the former taking precedence, by providing assistance to partner countries within its capabilities and genuinely supporting other developing countries to accelerate development. Simultaneously, through BRI cooperation, China aims to foster all-round opening up by building connections with other countries over land and sea while creating synergy between its eastern and western regions. It seeks to build a more advanced open economy and create a double development dynamic with the domestic economy as the mainstay and the domestic economy and international engagement providing mutual reinforcement. 2. Concepts: open, green and clean cooperation The BRI is committed to open, green and clean cooperation towards inclusive and sustainable development. It has zero tolerance for corruption and promotes steady and high-quality growth. The BRI is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by any single party. It is free from geopolitical calculations. It does not aim to create an exclusive club, nor does it target at any party. It does not form cliques based on specific ideological standards. It has no intention of establishing military alliances. Countries from Eurasia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania are all welcome to participate in the initiative, regardless of their political system, historical background, culture, development stage, ideology, or religious beliefs, as long as they seek common development. All participants uphold principles of openness and inclusiveness, while firmly opposing protectionism, unilateralism and hegemonism, and working together to create an all-round, three-dimensional landscape of interconnectivity. The goals are to develop a new model of cooperation based on win-win outcomes, shared responsibility, and collective participation, build a global network of partnerships, and nurture a harmonious coexistence for humanity. The BRI embraces the global trend of green and low-carbon development, emphasizes respecting and protecting nature and following its laws, and respects the right of all parties to pursue sustainable and eco-friendly growth. Based on a shared commitment to eco-environmental considerations, the parties involved have carried out policy dialogues, and shared ideas and achievements in green development. Through closer cooperation in areas such as green infrastructure, renewable energy, eco-friendly transport, and sustainable finance, all parties work together to broaden consensus and take concrete steps towards green development. The ultimate goal is to establish a resource-efficient, eco-conscious and low-carbon Silk Road, thereby making a significant contribution to protecting the eco-environment, achieving peak carbon and neutrality goals and addressing climate change. Leveraging its expertise in renewable energy, energy conservation, environmental protection and clean production, and employing Chinese technology, products and experience, China actively promotes BRI cooperation in green development. Clean governance is considered an intrinsic and necessary condition for the steady and sustained development of the BRI, with a commitment to transparency in cooperation. All participants joined to combat corruption, strengthening their legal systems and mechanisms, harmonizing their laws and regulations, and fostering international cooperation. Furthermore, all participants stand united against all forms of corruption and other international criminal activities, and work consistently to combat commercial bribery. This ensures that financial resources and projects are managed with integrity and efficiency, leading to greater outcomes and making BRI cooperation an example of clean governance. In April 2019, together with relevant countries, international organizations, and representatives from the business and academic communities, China launched the Beijing Initiative for the Clean Silk Road. This initiative calls for a clean Silk Road characterized by extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. Chinese companies expanding globally are committed to compliance and lawful operations, adhering to the laws of both China and the host countries and to international norms. They have particularly heightened their capacity to mitigate overseas operational risks, strengthening project supervision and management to ensure the delivery of clean, cost-efficient and high-quality projects. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) directly under the central government have released 868 guidelines of compliance in key areas, and defined 5,000-plus job compliance responsibilities; SOEs and financial institutions directly under the central government and their branches have formulated and updated more than 15,000 rules for managing overseas operations. In November 2020, more than 60 Chinese enterprises engaged in extensive BRI cooperation joined in launching the Integrity and Compliance Initiative for BRI Enterprises. 3. Objectives: high standards, sustainability, and better lives The BRI aims at high standards, sustainability, and better lives by raising cooperation standard, investment effectiveness, supply quality, and development resilience, delivering real and substantive results for all participants. The BRI introduces universally accepted rules and standards to guide business practices in project tendering, procurement, development and operation. It promotes high-standard cooperation and construction in various sectors. It advocates establishing free trade zones in alignment with international rules and standards, and implementing policies to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation to a higher level. This will ensure safe, smooth and orderly flows of people, goods, funds and data, and enable greater interconnectivity and deeper exchanges and cooperation. The approach emphasizes world-class standards, practicality, and cost-effectiveness. Pilot projects precede wider implementation, and participating countries are encouraged to adopt rules and the path adapted to their national conditions. China has established a high-level leadership organization and issued policy documents to consistently improve BRI design and implementation. In alignment with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the BRI promotes coordinated economic, social, and eco-environmental development. Its aims are to address the root causes and obstacles that hinder development and boost the self-driven development of participating countries. It strives to achieve lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, integrating sustainable development principles into project selection, implementation and management. Following international practices and debt sustainability principles, it is working to create a long-term, stable, sustainable and risk-controlled investment and financing system with innovative models and diverse channels in order to establish a stable, transparent and high-quality funding guarantee system that ensures commercial and fiscal sustainability. No participating country has fallen into a debt crisis as a result of BRI cooperation. The BRI takes a people-centered approach, with the focus on poverty eradication, job creation, and improvement of people's wellbeing to ensure that the benefits of cooperation reach all individuals. Deeper cooperation is encouraged in areas such as public health, poverty reduction, disaster mitigation, green development, science and technology, education, culture, arts, and health care. Closer exchanges are promoted among political parties, social organizations, think tanks, youth, women, and sub-national communities. These efforts aim to create projects that are grounded in the needs of the people, increasing their sense of gain and fulfillment. China actively promotes small-scale yet impactful projects through foreign aid, benefiting people's lives. From Asia to Africa, Latin America to the South Pacific, the construction of roads, railways, schools, hospitals and agricultural facilities contributes to poverty reduction and improves the people's wellbeing in participating countries. 4. Vision: a path to global wellbeing An initiative towards progress, cooperation and inclusiveness, the BRI pursues development, promotes win-win outcomes, and inspires hope. It aims to deepen understanding and trust, strengthen comprehensive exchanges, and ultimately achieve common development and shared prosperity. A path to peace. Peace is a prerequisite for development, while development serves as the foundation for peace. The BRI goes beyond the law of the jungle and the hegemonic order based on power struggles. It rejects zero-sum thinking and discards the Cold War mentality of ideological rivalry and geopolitical competition. Instead, it paves the way for peaceful development, and aims to offer a fundamental approach to lasting peace and universal security. Under the BRI, nations respect each other's sovereignty, dignity, territorial integrity, development path, social system, core interests, and major concerns. As the initiator of the BRI, China passionately campaigns for the establishment of a new model of international relations characterized by mutual respect, equity, justice, and win-win cooperation. It is committed to building partnerships based on dialogue rather than confrontation, and friendship rather than alliance, and to fostering a new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. These efforts help to create a peaceful and stable development environment. A path to prosperity. The BRI is committed to building a prosperous future that diverges from the exploitative colonialism of the past, avoids coercive and one-sided transactions, rejects the center-periphery model of dependency, and refuses to displace crisis onto others or exploit neighbors for self-interest. Instead, it aims to achieve win-win outcomes and shared development and prosperity. Under the BRI, all parties will prioritize development as the common goal, leveraging their respective resources and potential advantages, igniting their own growth engines, growing their capacity for independent development, and collectively creating more opportunities and space for development. This collaborative effort aims to foster new centers and impetus for global economic growth, drive inclusive growth, and bring global development into a balanced, coordinated and inclusive new stage. A path to openness. The BRI represents an open and inclusive collaborative process that transcends national borders, ideological differences, developmental disparities, social system variations, and geopolitical conflicts. It is not aimed at designing a new international system, but rather supplementing and improving the existing mechanisms. All parties involved uphold the core values and fundamental principles of the multilateral trading system. Together, participants will establish an open and cooperative platform, safeguard and promote an open global economy, create an environment conducive to open development, construct a fair, equitable and transparent system of international trade and investment rules, and advance cooperation based on win-win outcomes, shared responsibility and collective participation. The BRI facilitates the orderly flow of production factors, the efficient allocation of resources, deep integration of markets, and liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, and ensures the stable performance and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains. It aims to build an economic globalization that is open, inclusive, balanced, and beneficial to all. A path to innovation. Innovation serves as a critical driving force for progress. The BRI is dedicated to innovation-led development, harnessing the opportunities presented by digital, internet-based and smart development. It explores new business forms, technologies and models, seeking out fresh sources of growth and innovative development pathways to propel transformative advancements for all involved. Participants collaborate to connect digital infrastructure, build the Digital Silk Road, strengthen innovative cooperation in cutting-edge fields, and promote the deep integration of science, technology, industry and finance. These efforts aim to optimize the environment for innovation, gather innovative resources, foster a regional ecosystem of collaborative innovation, and bridge the digital divide, injecting strong momentum into common development. A path to social progress. The BRI champions equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness among civilizations. It upholds the shared values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom. It transcends barriers between cultures through exchanges, resolves conflicts through mutual understanding, and rejects superiority while promoting coexistence. It encourages civilizations to appreciate their differences, seek common ground, and learn from one another. Parties involved will establish multitiered mechanisms for people-to-people cooperation, create more platforms and channels, and facilitate exchanges across various fields. These efforts aim to reinforce mutual understanding, respect and trust among nations, broaden consensus on ideas and values, and achieve new human progress. III. Promoting All-Round Connectivity in Multiple Fields To promote greater connectivity through BRI cooperation, we have continued to facilitate policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and closer people-to-people ties, by orienting towards ""hard connectivity"" in infrastructure, bolstering ""soft connectivity"" through harmonized rules and standards, and strengthening people-to-people bonds. As its scope expands, the BRI has become the world\'s largest platform for international cooperation, with the broadest coverage. 1. Extensive and in-depth policy coordination Policy coordination underpins BRI cooperation. China has worked with participating countries and international organizations to establish a multilevel policy coordination and communication mechanism for aligning development strategies, technological and economic policies, and administration rules and standards. Under this mechanism, plans and measures for regional cooperation have been formulated through joint efforts to facilitate and speed up cooperation, making the BRI an important collaborative framework for international exchanges. Strategy and policy coordination is expanding in scope. At the global level, the 193 UN member states unanimously agreed to incorporate the Belt and Road Initiative in the UN resolution passed at the 71st United Nations General Assembly in November 2016. In March 2017, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2344, calling for stronger regional economic cooperation through the BRI, among other initiatives. The United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organization (WHO) have signed BRI cooperation agreements with China. At the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's efforts have facilitated the conclusion of the negotiations on the text of the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement, with a view to establishing a coordinated and unified investment management system covering more than 110 countries and regions to encourage BRI cooperation on investment. At regional and multilateral levels, the BRI has supported regional integration and global development by aligning with plans such as the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, the African Union's Agenda 2063, and the European Union's Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia. At the bilateral level, the BRI has succeeded in coordinating with a wide range of strategies and initiatives, including Russia's Eurasian Economic Union framework, Kazakhstan's Bright Road economic policy, Turkmenistan's strategy of reviving the Silk Road, Mongolia's Steppe Road plan, Indonesia's Global Marine Fulcrum initiative, the Philippines' Build Better More program, Vietnam's Two Corridors and One Economic Circle plan, South Africa's Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, Egypt's Suez Canal Corridor Project, and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. By June 2023, China had signed more than 200 BRI cooperation agreements with more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations across five continents, yielding a number of signature projects and small-scale yet impactful projects. A long-term mechanism for policy coordination is largely in place. Multilevel channels for regular communication among different parties have been opened up on different platforms. This has been made possible through top-down driven diplomatic efforts led by heads of state, with support from intergovernmental strategic communication and local and interdepartmental policy coordination, and with cooperation projects carried out by enterprises and social organizations. China has hosted the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation twice, providing an important platform for participating countries and international organizations to expand exchanges, increase mutual trust, and strengthen ties. The first forum in 2017 welcomed heads of state and government from 29 countries, and more than 1,600 representatives from 140-plus countries and 80-plus international organizations, yielding a total of 279 deliverables in five categories. At the second forum held in 2019, 40 leaders, including heads of state and government from 38 countries, the UN secretary-general and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, attended the Leaders' Roundtable. More than 6,000 representatives participated, from over 150 countries and 92 international organizations, yielding 283 deliverables in 6 categories. Multilateral cooperation is driving forward. Under the BRI framework, Chinese and foreign partners have launched 20-plus multilateral dialogue and cooperation mechanisms in professional domains such as railways, ports, energy, finance, taxation, environmental protection, disaster prevention and relief, think tanks, and the media, attracting a growing number of participants. BRI participating countries have also expanded practical cooperation through major multilateral platforms such as China-ASEAN (10+1) Cooperation, Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum, China-Central and Eastern European Countries Cooperation, World Economic Forum, Boao Forum for Asia, and CPC and World Political Parties Summit. Rules and standards are being coordinated. Cooperation on standardization has advanced to new levels. As of June 2023, China had signed 107 documents with standardization bodies in 65 countries such as Pakistan, Russia, Greece, Ethiopia, and Costa Rica and also with regional and international organizations, in areas covering civil aviation, climate change, agri-food, building materials, electric vehicles, oil and gas pipelines, logistics, small hydropower stations, oceanography, and surveying and mapping. The Standard Information Platform Contributed by the Belt and Road Countries provides overviews of standards information in 149 partner countries, and full-text search services for standards catalogues regarding 59 countries and 6 regional and international standardization organizations, serving as a bridge for participating countries. Chinese standards in foreign language versions have been supplied in larger quantities. Nearly 1,400 national standards and more than 1,000 industry standards have been published in foreign languages. In May 2022, the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization opened a regional arbitration center in Hong Kong, providing solutions for multilateral disputes in BRI cooperation. China has continued to strengthen cross-border accounting and auditing regulatory cooperation with 22 countries and regions including Russia, Malaysia and Singapore, providing institutional guarantees for expanding cross-border investment and financing channels. 2. Growing connectivity of infrastructure The BRI prioritizes connectivity of infrastructure. Based on a framework comprising ""six corridors, six routes, and multiple countries and ports"", a multitiered and multidimensional infrastructure network is taking shape. Basic connectivity over land, maritime, air and cyberspace is in place, laying solid foundations for deeper cooperation in trade and industrial capacity, and strengthening cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The construction of economic corridors and international routes is making substantial progress. Participating countries have pressed forward with the creation of international arterial routes, building an infrastructure network that connects subregions in Asia as well as the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. Major projects along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor are under way. The Peshawar-Karachi Motorway (Sukkur-Multan section), the Karakoram Highway Phase II(Havelian-Thakot section), and the Lahore Orange Line Metro are all open to traffic. Coal-fired power plants such as Sahiwal, Port Qasim, Thar, and Hub are operating safely and steadily; the Mehra DC transmission project is operational; and the Kalot Hydropower Station is connected to the power grid. Rashakai Special Economic Zone has reached the stage of comprehensive development. Along the New Eurasian Land Bridge, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway in Serbia became operational in March 2022, and track-laying has started on the Budapest-Kelebija section in Hungary. The Peljesac Bridge in Croatia has celebrated its first anniversary of opening to traffic. The Western Europe-Western China Highway has been completed. The Smokovac-Matesevo section of the Bar-Boljare Highway in Montenegro has been completed and is open to traffic. Along the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor, the China-Laos Railway has been completed and is providing sound service, and its role as a golden transport channel is becoming increasingly prominent. The Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway, the flagship project of BRI cooperation between China and Indonesia, has achieved an operational speed of 350 km per hour. The contract for the China-Thailand Railway Phase I (Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima section) was signed online, and 11 sections of the construction project have started, including one that has been completed. Along the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor, the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk Highway Bridge and the Tongjiang-Nizhneleninskoye Railway Bridge, connecting China and Russia, have opened to traffic. The China-Russia eastern natural gas pipeline is fully operational. China, Russia and Mongolia have officially launched a feasibility study on the upgrading and development of the central-route railway of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor. Along the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor, the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Highway is in full operation. The China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline is fully operational. The grain and oil rail transport lines between North Kazakhstan and China are operating in conjunction with the China-Europe Railway Express. Along the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, the China-Myanmar Crude Oil and Gas Pipeline has been completed and entered service. The feasibility study on the Muse-Mandalay section of the China-Myanmar Railway has been completed, and the feasibility study on the Mandalay-Kyaukphyu section has been launched. Construction projects in Bangladesh, including the Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge and the Dohazari-Cox's Bazar rail route, have made good progress. Panel 1 Mombasa-Nairobi Railway promotes Kenya's economic and social development The Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya connects Mombasa, the largest port in East Africa, and Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. It extends further northwest to Suswa. The line is 592 kilometers long. It utilizes Chinese standards, technology, equipment, and project management. It is an important success story in BRI cooperation between China and Kenya, and is hailed as a route of friendship, of win-win cooperation, of development and prosperity, and of eco-environmental protection. The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway is the largest infrastructure project undertaken in Kenya since independence. Since it opened in 2017, the railway has had a positive impact on Kenya's economic and social development and the people's wellbeing; it has also significantly reduced the logistics costs of products from the inland regions of East Africa exported through the Mombasa Port. As of August 31, 2023, the railway is operating an average of 6 passenger trains per day; a total of 11 million passengers have been carried, and the average occupancy rate is above 95 percent; an average of 17 freight trains operate daily, and a total of 28 million tonnes of goods have been transported. According to Kenyan government estimates, the railway has added 2 percent to Kenya's economic growth. In the construction and operation of the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, Chinese enterprises have supported technology transfer and provided training to local employees. During the construction period, more than 30,000 local employees received orientation training, and every year a number of young Kenyans were selected to participate in training and academic education in China. Since the opening of the railway, Chinese companies have adopted tailored training methods for different people, professions and posts, and have trained 1,152 professionals for Kenya. In Africa, railways such as the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway are now operational and have become important drivers of in-depth development not only in East Africa but across the entire continent. Maritime connectivity is steadily improving. Cooperation is expanding in shipping among the ports of participating countries, and the efficiency of cargo transportation has seen notable increase. The annual cargo throughput of the Port of Piraeus in Greece has increased to above 5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), making it the fourth largest TEU port in Europe and a leading TEU port in the Mediterranean. The Gwadar Port in Pakistan has seen major progress and is marching towards the goal of becoming a logistics center and industrial base. Preliminary work is currently under way on the Kyaukphyu Deep-sea Port project in Myanmar, including geological exploration and environmental and social assessment. The annual throughput of bulk cargo at Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka has increased to 1.21 million tonnes. The Vado Gateway terminal has become the first semi-automatic terminal operating in Italy. The Lekki Deep-sea Port in Nigeria has been completed and entered service, becoming a major modern deep-water port in Central and Western Africa. The Silk Road Maritime network has continued to expand. By the end of June 2023, it had reached 117 ports in 43 countries, and more than 300 well-known Chinese and international shipping companies, port enterprises and think tanks, among other bodies, have joined the Silk Road Maritime association. A marine environment forecast and support system that focuses on areas along the Maritime Silk Road offers services to more than 100 cities in participating countries. The Air Silk Road has made notable progress. The aviation route network between participating countries is expanding rapidly, and the level of air connectivity is steadily improving. China has signed bilateral air transport agreements with 104 BRI partner countries and opened direct flights with 57 partner countries to facilitate cross-border transport. Chinese enterprises are active participants in civil aviation infrastructure cooperation with partner countries including Pakistan, Nepal and Togo, helping to develop the local civil aviation industry. A BRI cooperation platform proposed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China was established in August 2020, improving mechanisms and platforms of civil aviation exchanges and cooperation among participating countries. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a direct line of the Air Silk Road linking Zhengzhou in Henan Province and Luxemburg did not suspend its air or freighting services, and transported a large amount of supplies. It served as an air lifeline between China and Europe, and contributed to keeping international industrial and supply chains stable. International inter-modality transport channels continue to enjoy stable development. These channels include the China-Europe Railway Express, the China-Europe Land-Sea Express Line, the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and the Lianyungang-Khorgos New Eurasian Land-Sea Expressway. The China-Europe Railway Express has now reached more than 200 cities in 25 European countries, comprising 86 routes passing through the main regions of the Eurasian hinterland at a speed of 120 km per hour. Its logistics distribution network covers the entire Eurasian continent. By the end of June 2023, the cumulative volume of the China-Europe Railway Express had exceeded 74,000 trips, transporting nearly 7 million TEUs and over 50,000 types of goods in 53 categories such as automobiles, mechanical equipment, and electronic products, to a total value of more than US$300 billion. The China-Europe Land-Sea Express Line has emerged from scratch to become the third trade channel between China and Europe, after traditional sea routes and the China-Europe Railway Express. In 2022, more than 180,000 TEUs were transported through this line, with rail trips exceeding 2,600. The routes of rail-sea freight trains of the New International Land-sea Trade Corridor cover 18 provinces and equivalent administrative units, in central and western China, transporting goods to 300-plus ports in more than 100 countries. 3. Unimpeded, convenient and efficient trade Facilitating trade and investment is a major task in building the Belt and Road. The participating countries have worked hard to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, remove investment and trade barriers, and improve the business environment within the region and in all related countries. Efforts have been made to build free trade zones, broaden trading areas, improve trade structure, expand areas of mutual investment and industrial cooperation, establish a more balanced, equal and sustainable trading system, and develop mutually beneficial economic and trade relations, so as to make the ""pie"" of cooperation bigger. Trade and investment are expanding steadily. From 2013 to 2022, the cumulative value of imports and exports between China and BRI partner countries reached US$19.1 trillion, with an average annual growth rate of 6.4 percent. The cumulative two-way investment between China and partner countries reached US$380 billion, including US$240 billion from China. The value of newly signed construction contracts with partner countries reached US$2 trillion, and the actual turnover of Chinese contractors reached US$1.3 trillion. In 2022, the value of imports and exports between China and partner countries reached nearly US$2.9 trillion, accounting for 45.4 percent of China's total foreign trade over the same period, representing an increase of 6.2 percentage points compared with 2013; the total value of imports and exports of Chinese private enterprises to partner countries exceeded US$1.5 trillion, accounting for 53.7 percent of the trade between China and these countries over the same period. Trade and investment liberalization and facilitation is improving. BRI participating countries continue to uphold multilateralism and free trade, working hard to create a sound institutional environment for closer economic and trade relations. Positive progress has been made in the alignment of working systems, coordination of technical standards, mutual recognition of inspection results, and online verification of electronic certificates. By the end of August 2023, more than 80 countries and international organizations had subscribed to the Initiative on Promoting Unimpeded Trade Cooperation Along the Belt and Road, proposed by China. China had signed 21 free trade agreements with 28 countries and regions. On January 1, 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement entered into force, creating the world's largest free trade zone in terms of population size and trade volume. The RCEP and the BRI overlap and complement each other in terms of participating countries and regions, as well as areas and contents of cooperation, forming a new dynamic of economic and trade cooperation in Asia. China also works actively towards joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. China has signed bilateral investment agreements with 135 countries and regions, and conventions for the avoidance of double taxation (including arrangements and agreements) with 112 countries and regions. It has achieved Authorized Economic Operator mutual recognition with 35 partner countries, and has signed third-party market cooperation documents with 14 countries. China has established a ""single-window"" cooperation mechanism with Singapore, Pakistan, Mongolia, Iran and other partner countries, and signed cooperation documents on customs inspection and quarantine, effectively improving the efficiency of customs clearance at border ports. Trade and investment platforms are playing a growing role. China International Import Expo (CIIE) is the world's first import-themed national-level expo and has been held for the past five years. It has resulted in a cumulative intended turnover of nearly US$350 billion, and about 2,000 launches of new products. With diverse participants from many countries and regions, the CIIE has become a global platform for international procurement, investment promotion, cultural exchanges, and open cooperation. The influence of key exhibitions continues to expand; these include China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair), China International Fair for Trade in Services, China International Fair for Investment and Trade, China International Consumer Products Expo, Global Digital Trade Expo, China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo, China-Arab States Expo, China-Russia Expo, China-CEEC Expo & International Consumer Goods Fair, China-ASEAN Expo, and China-Eurasia Expo. All of these have provided a strong boost to trade and investment cooperation among participating countries. The Hong Kong SAR has held the Belt and Road Summit eight times, and the Macao SAR has held the International Infrastructure Investment and Construction Forum 14 times, which have played an important role in advancing economic, trade and investment cooperation along the Belt and Road. Industrial cooperation is deepening. BRI participating countries have worked hard to foster a paradigm of cooperation based on coordinated development, mutual benefit, and win-win outcomes, which has given a strong boost to upgrading industrial structures and optimizing industrial chains in the countries involved. The participating countries have jointly promoted cooperation on industrial capacity, expanded cooperation in traditional industries including steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials, automobiles, engineering machinery, resources and energy, and agriculture, explored cooperation in emerging industries such as the digital economy, new energy vehicles, nuclear energy and technology, and 5G, and carried out tri-party and multiparty market cooperation, thus advancing mutual complementarity and providing mutual benefits to all parties. By the end of June 2023, China had signed agreements on industrial capacity cooperation with more than 40 countries. China Mining Conference& Exhibition and China-ASEAN Mining Cooperation Forum& Exhibition serve as important platforms for participating countries to conduct mining capacity cooperation. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Demonstration Base for Agricultural Technology Exchange and Training has supported advances in agricultural science and technology under the BRI, and promoted economic and trade cooperation in agriculture among participating countries. Jointly constructed by China and Pakistan, the K2 and K3 units of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant have been completed and are in operation, utilizing China's Hualong One nuclear technology. The Ulba Fuel Assembly Plant, a successful joint venture between China and Kazakhstan, is now operational. The China-ASEAN Forum on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Technology has served as a bridge to establish connectivity, enabling BRI participating countries to cooperate on nuclear technology and promote growth and people's wellbeing. More than 70 overseas industrial parks have been built by Chinese enterprises together with governments and enterprises in partner countries. The China-Malaysia and China-Indonesia ""Two Countries, Twin Parks"" projects, the China-Belarus Great Stone Industrial Park, the China-UAE Industrial Capacity Cooperation Demonstration Zone, and the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone are making steady progress. 4. Diverse dynamics of financial integration Financial integration is an important pillar of BRI cooperation. Participating countries and relevant institutions have carried out multiple forms of financial cooperation, created new models, expanded the channels, diversified the parties involved, and improved the mechanisms for investment and financing. They have promoted policy-based finance, development finance, commercial finance, and cooperative finance to support BRI cooperation, and worked to build a long-term, stable and sustainable investment and financing system that keeps risk under control. The financial cooperation mechanisms are maturing. China Development Bank (CDB) has promoted the establishment of multilateral financial cooperation mechanisms such as China-Central and Eastern Europe Interbank Consortium, the China-Arab Countries Interbank Association, China-ASEAN Interbank Association, the ASEAN Plus Three Interbank Cooperation mechanism, China-Africa Interbank Association, and the Association of China-LAC Development Financial Institutions. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has promoted the Belt and Road Interbank Regular Cooperation (BRBR) mechanism. As of the end of June 2023, a total of 13 Chinese-funded banks had established 145 first-tier offices and branches in 50 BRI partner countries; some 17.7 million businesses in 131 partner countries had opened UnionPay services, and 74 partner countries had opened UnionPay mobile payment services. The Belt and Road Innovation and Development Center, the Research Center for Belt and Road Financial and Economic Development, and the China-IMF Capacity Development Center have been established. China has signed bilateral currency swap agreements with 20 partner countries and established renminbi (RMB) clearing arrangements in 17 partner countries. The number of participants, business volume, and influence of the RMB cross-border payment system have gradually increased, effectively facilitating trade and investment. Financial regulation cooperation and exchanges have continued to move forward. China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (now National Administration of Financial Regulation), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and regulatory agencies from multiple other countries have signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for regulatory cooperation, facilitating the establishment of regional regulatory coordination mechanisms, promoting efficient allocation of funds, strengthening risk control, and creating sound investment conditions for various financial institutions and investment entities. The channels and platforms for investment and financing are constantly expanding. China has funded the establishment of the Silk Road Fund (SRF) and established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with other participating countries. The SRF specifically serves BRI cooperation. By the end of June 2023, the fund had signed agreements on 75 projects with committed investment of about US$22 billion; the number of AIIB members had reached 106, and the bank had approved 227 projects with a total investment of US$43.6 billion. The projects involve transport, energy, public health and other fields, providing investment and financing support for infrastructure connectivity and sustainable economic and social development. China has actively participated in various existing financing arrangements. It has signed memorandums of cooperation with international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, worked with international financial institutions to establish a multilateral development financing cooperation center, strengthened third-party market cooperation in investment and financing with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and carried out joint financing with the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank and others. These moves have effectively mobilized market capital. China has initiated the establishment of international economic cooperation funds such as the China-Eurasian Economic Cooperation Fund, the China-LAC Cooperation Fund, the China-Central and Eastern Europe Investment Cooperation Fund, the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund, the China-LAC Industrial Cooperation Investment Fund, and the China-Africa Fund for Industrial Cooperation. These have effectively expanded investment and financing channels for partner countries. The CDB and the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) have each set up special loans for the BRI to pool resources to increase financing support for BRI cooperation. By the end of 2022, the CDB has provided direct high-quality financial services for more than 1,300 BRI projects, playing a leading role in guiding development finance, and pooling all kinds of domestic and foreign funds for BRI cooperation. The balance of loans of China Eximbank for BRI projects reached RMB2.2 trillion, covering 130-plus participating countries and driving more than US$400 billion of investment and more than US$2 trillion of trade. China Export& Credit Insurance Corporation has fully applied export credit insurance and actively provided comprehensive guarantees for building the Belt and Road. Innovative investment and financing methods are steadily being explored. Various models such as funds and bonds have been developed, and BRI financial cooperation is improving. China's securities industry has set up a number of BRI-themed funds and indexes. In December 2015, the CSRC officially launched a pilot project for overseas institutions to issue RMB-denominated bonds (panda bonds) in China's exchange-traded bond market. By the end of June 2023, overseas issuers in total had issued 99 panda bonds in China's exchange-traded bond market, with a total value of RMB152.54 billion; 46 BRI-themed bonds had been issued, with a total value of RMB52.72 billion. Green finance is steadily developing. In May 2019, the ICBC issued the first green BRBR bond that conformed to both international and domestic green bond standards. By the end of 2022, more than 40 large global institutions had signed the Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road. In June 2023, China Eximbank issued financial bonds for promoting international cooperation in building the Belt and Road and supporting infrastructure construction of partner countries. China's domestic stock and futures exchanges have steadily promoted practical cooperation in equity, products, technology and other fields with the exchanges in partner countries, and actively supported the development of exchanges participating in or holding shares in BRI projects, such as the Astana International Exchange in Kazakhstan, the Pakistan Stock Exchange, and the Dhaka Stock Exchange in Bangladesh. Debt sustainability has continued to improve. Based on the principle of equal participation and benefit and risk sharing, China and 28 countries approved the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, encouraging the governments, financial institutions and enterprises of participating countries to attach importance to debt sustainability and improve their debt management capability. Drawing on the debt sustainability framework of low-income countries endorsed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, China has developed tools based on the actual conditions of participating countries, and issued the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative. All parties are encouraged to use it on a voluntary basis. To avoid causing debt risk and financial burden to the countries where BRI projects are located, China has prioritized economic and social benefits and provided loans for project construction based on local needs and conditions. The key areas of investment are infrastructure projects designed to increase connectivity, and projects for public wellbeing urgently needed in participating countries. These have brought effective investment, increased high-quality assets, and boosted development momentum. Many think tank experts and international institutions have pointed out that almost all the BRI projects are initiated by the host countries with the goals of growing their economies and improving their people's lives. In the process, the logic of economics has taken precedence over geopolitics. 5. Solid foundations for people-to-people ties People-to-people ties are the social foundations of BRI cooperation. The participating countries have passed on and carried forward the spirit of friendly cooperation of the ancient Silk Road, cooperated on exchanges in culture, tourism, education, think tank and the media, and promoted mutual learning among civilizations and cultural integration and innovation. A model of people-to-people exchanges characterized by dynamic interactions and diversity has underpinned public support for furthering the initiative. Cooperation on culture and tourism is rich and colorful. By the end of June 2023, China had signed cultural and tourism cooperation documents with 144 BRI partner countries. China has created cooperation platforms together with participating countries, including the Silk Road International League of Theaters, the Silk Road International Museum Alliance, the Network of Silk Road Arts Festivals, the Silk Road International Library Alliance, and the Silk Road International Alliance of Art Museums and Galleries. These platforms have a total of 562 members, including 326 cultural institutions from 72 partner countries. China is steadily expanding international cultural exchanges. China has launched the Cultural Silk Road program, and organized signature events such as the Happy Chinese New Year celebrations, the Nihao China tourism promotions, and the Silk Road: Artists' Rendezvous art exhibition. It has worked with Brunei, Cambodia, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Russia and ASEAN to co-host cultural and tourism activities at designated years. China and BRI partner countries have hosted events in a reciprocal manner, ranging from cultural relics exhibitions, film festivals, arts festivals, book fairs and music festivals, and jointly translated and promoted each other's publishing, radio, film and television programs. They have also implemented the BRI-themed theater arts creation and promotion project, the Belt and Road International Art Project, and the Belt and Road good-neighborliness cultural project, and worked to protect Asian cultural heritage. China has established 46 China cultural centers in 44 countries, of which 32 are partner countries. China has established 20 tourism offices in 18 countries, eight of which are in partner countries. Educational exchanges and cooperation are extensive and profound. China has released the Education Action Plan for the Belt and Road Initiative to promote international education exchanges and cooperation. By the end of June 2023, China had signed agreements with 45 participating countries on the mutual recognition of higher education degrees. China has set up the Silk Road Program under the Chinese Government Scholarship scheme. Some of China's provinces and Hong Kong and Macao SARs, as well as universities and research institutions have also set up scholarships for students from BRI partner countries. Chinese universities and colleges have opened 313 Confucius Institutes and 315 Confucius Classrooms in 132 partner countries. The ""Chinese Bridge"" Summer Camp has invited nearly 50,000 young people from more than 100 partner countries to come to China for academic visits, and supported 100,000 Chinese language enthusiasts from 143 partner countries to learn Chinese and experience Chinese culture online. Chinese universities and colleges have worked with more than 20 counterparts in partner countries from Asia, Africa and Europe to build a number of Luban Workshops  a professional training program dedicated to the sharing of expertise by China's vocational education institutions. China and UNESCO have jointly held the International Youth Forum on Creativity and Heritage Along the Silk Roads and relevant activities in seven consecutive years, and established the Silk Roads Youth Research Grant which has funded 24 youth research projects. The Atomic Energy Scholarship of China has funded the education of nearly 200 Master's and Doctoral students in the field of peaceful use of nuclear energy for 26 BRI partner countries. Participating countries have capitalized on the demonstration and driving role of the University Alliance and the Alliance of International Science Organizations (ANSO) under the BRI framework, and expanded international exchanges and cooperation in talent training and scientific research. Media and think tank cooperation has yielded fruitful results. BRI participating countries have held the Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road six times, and established the Belt and Road Media Community. The China-Arab States Forum on Radio and Television Cooperation, the Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation, the China-Cambodia Radio and Television Annual Regular Cooperation Conference, the ASEAN-China Media Cooperation Forum, the Lancang-Mekong Audiovisual Week, and other bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms have been set up. International organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union and the Arab States Broadcasting Union have become active and important platforms for building consensus among participating countries. Media outlets in China and partner countries have jointly established the Belt and Road News Network, which launched the Silk Road Global News Awards. By the end of June 2023, the network's members had increased to 233 media outlets in 107 countries. Think tank exchanges have become more frequent. The Advisory Council of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was established in 2018. The Silk Road Think Tank Association has recruited 122 partners in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Sixteen Chinese and foreign think tanks have established the Belt and Road Studies Network. People-to-people exchanges are constantly expanding. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continue to strengthen cooperation with the goals of benefiting the people, improving their lives, and connecting their hearts. At the people-to-people ties sub-forum of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, Chinese and foreign NGOs, including China NGO Network for International Exchanges, combined to launch the Silk Road Community Building Initiative, encouraging Chinese and foreign NGOs to establish nearly 600 cooperative partnership pairings and carry out more than 300 cooperation projects for improving people's lives. Of these, some brand projects have achieved a wide impact, including the Shenzhen-Lancang-Mekong Cooperation to benefit the people in the Lancang-Mekong region with Shenzhen's advanced products and technology, the Panda Pack Project to provide primary school students with learning supplies, and the Brightness Journey program to provide free cataract surgery to those in need. Cities from 60-plus BRI partner countries have formed more than 1,000 pairs of friendly cities with their Chinese counterparts. A total of 352 NGOs from 72 countries and regions have formed a Silk Road NGO Cooperation Network, carrying out over 500 projects and various other activities, and becoming an important platform for exchanges and cooperation between NGOs in participating countries. 6. Steady progress in new areas Leveraging their respective strengths, participating countries have continued to expand BRI cooperation into new fields and created innovative cooperation models, achieving great progress in building a healthy, green, innovative and digital Silk Road and further broadening the space for international cooperation. Notable achievements have been made in health cooperation. To establish closer partnerships in health cooperation, participating countries are working hard to build a Health Silk Road and a global community of health for all. By the end of June 2023, China had signed an MoU with the WHO on health cooperation in BRI partner countries, inked health cooperation agreements with more than 160 countries and international organizations, and initiated or participated in nine international and regional health cooperation mechanisms, including China-Africa Health Cooperation, China-Arab States Health Cooperation, and China-ASEAN Health Cooperation. Relying on mechanisms and platforms such as the Belt & Road Health Professionals Development Alliance, the Belt & Road Hospital Cooperation Alliance, the Belt& Road Health Policy Research Network, and the China-ASEAN Human Resources Training Program of Health Silk Road (2020-2022), China has helped BRI partner countries to train tens of thousands of professionals in health management, public health and medical research. It has also dispatched medical teams to 58 partner countries, and provided free treatment for nearly 10,000 cataract patients in more than 30 partner countries through the Brightness Journey program. In addition, China has sent several rounds of medical aid to island states of the South Pacific, and carried out international medical cooperation with neighboring countries, including countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion, Central Asian countries, and Mongolia. After the outbreak of Covid-19, China provided assistance to more than 120 BRI partner countries to combat the pandemic, and sent 38 expert medical teams to 34 countries. It started the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Covid-19 Vaccines Cooperation together with 31 countries, delivered more than 2 billion doses of vaccines to partner countries, and conducted joint vaccine production with more than 20 countries, improving vaccine affordability and accessibility in developing countries. In addition, China has signed documents on traditional medicine cooperation with 14 BRI partner countries; eight partner countries have taken measures to support the development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) within the framework of their respective legal systems; 30 overseas TCM centers have been built; and 100-plus TCM drugs have been registered and marketed in partner countries. Remarkable progress has been achieved in green and low-carbon development. China is working together with partner countries and international organizations to build a cooperation mechanism for green and low-carbon development under the BRI framework, promote green development, and address climate change. China has issued documents such as the Guidance on Promoting Green Belt and Road and the Guidelines on Jointly Promoting Green Development of the Belt and Road, and set itself the ambitious goal of forming a basic framework of green development through BRI cooperation by 2030. China has also signed an MoU with the United Nations Environment Programme on building a green Belt and Road for 2017-2022, reached environmental cooperation agreements with more than 30 countries and international organizations, launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development together with 31 countries, formed the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition with more than 150 partners from 40-plus countries, and established the Belt and Road Energy Partnership with 32 countries. China has pledged to stop building new coal-fired power stations overseas, and to actively build green finance platforms and international cooperation mechanisms. It stands ready to cooperate with partner countries on research into biodiversity conservation, safeguarding the eco-environmental security of the Maritime Silk Road, building the Belt and Road Big Data Service Platform on Ecological and Environmental Protection and the Belt and Road Environmental Technology Exchange and Transfer Center, and implementing the Green Silk Road Envoys Program. China is actively promoting the Belt and Road South-South Cooperation Initiative on Climate Change. It has signed 47 South-South MoUs on climate change with 39 partner countries, built low-carbon demonstration zones with Laos, Cambodia, and Seychelles, carried out more than 70 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects with 30-plus developing countries, and trained more than 3,000 environment management personnel and experts from more than 120 countries. In May 2023, China Eximbank, together with a dozen financial institutions including China Development Bank, and China Export& Credit Insurance Corporation, released the Initiative for Supporting Belt and Road Energy Transition with Green Finance, calling on all parties involved to strengthen support for green and low-carbon energy transition in BRI participating countries. Cooperation in scientific and technological innovation is gathering speed. BRI participating countries are strengthening cooperation on innovation, facilitating technology transfer and knowledge sharing, optimizing the innovation-enabling environment, and pooling innovation resources. They are also building up their capacity for scientific and technological innovation through cooperation in major projects and talent training. In October 2016, China released the Special Plan on Advancing Belt and Road Cooperation in Scientific and Technological Innovation. In May 2017, the Action Plan on Belt and Road Cooperation in Scientific and Technological Innovation was implemented, to increase the capacity for innovation in BRI participating countries through pragmatic measures such as joint research, technology transfer, exchanges in science, technology and culture, and cooperation between high-tech industrial parks. By the end of June 2023, China had signed intergovernmental agreements on scientific and technological cooperation with more than 80 BRI partner countries, and 58 members had joined the ANSO. Since 2013, China has hosted more than 10,000 young scientists from partner countries in carrying out short-term research and exchanges in China, and trained more than 16,000 technicians and management professionals for partner countries; China has established nine cross-border technology transfer platforms targeting ASEAN, South Asia, Arab states, Africa, Latin America, and other regions; China has assisted 22 African countries to build 23 agricultural technology demonstration centers, and set up 50-plus BRI joint laboratories in areas such as agriculture, new energy, and health. China has signed an agreement with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on strengthening BRI cooperation on intellectual property and additional agreements on subsequent revision and prolongation of the said agreement. China and the WIPO have jointly hosted twice the High-level Conference on Intellectual Property for Countries Along the Belt and Road, and released a joint initiative and a joint statement on strengthening cooperation on intellectual property. To date, China has established intellectual property cooperation relationships with more than 50 partner countries and international organizations, whose goal is to create an innovation and business environment in which the value of knowledge is duly respected. Digital silk road cooperation presents numerous highlights. BRI participating countries have joined to create an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for digital development by strengthening facilitation of and cooperation on rules and standards and promoting regional policy coordination. By the end of 2022, China had signed MoUs on building the Digital Silk Road with 17 countries, MoUs on e-commerce cooperation with 30 countries, and MoUs on closer investment cooperation in the digital economy with 18 countries and regions. It has proposed and worked to launch the Global Initiative on Data Security, the Belt and Road Digital Economy International Cooperation Initiative, the initiative for building the ASEAN-China Partnership on Digital Economy Cooperation, the China-League of Arab States Cooperation Initiative on Data Security, the China+ Central Asia Data Security Cooperation Initiative, and the BRICS Digital Economy Partnership Framework, among others. It also took lead in formulating the Framework of Standards on Cross-border E-commerce. China is active in strengthening digital infrastructure connectivity and is stepping up work on digital corridors. Several international submarine cables have made positive progress, and 130 cross-border terrestrial cable systems have been built. China has built many 5G base stations, data centers, cloud computing centers and smart cities, and promoted digital upgrading and transformation of traditional infrastructure such as ports, railways, highways, energy networks and water conservancy facilities. A number of key projects such as the China-ASEAN Information Harbor, and the digital platform of China-Europe Railway Express and the China-Arab Online Silk Road is making good progress, and the DBAR Big Earth Data Platform has realized multilingual data sharing. Panel 2 Silk Road E-commerce expands new channels for economic and trade cooperation Thriving new business models of international trade, represented by cross-border e-commerce and overseas warehouses, are providing better services and more choice to global consumers, and promoting global trade innovations. Silk Road E-commerce is an important means by which China can capitalize on its strengths in e-commerce technology application, model innovation and market size, expand economic and trade cooperation, and share the opportunities of digital development with BRI participants. By the end of September 2023, China had established bilateral mechanisms of e-commerce cooperation with 30 countries on five continents; multilateral mechanisms had been built under the China-CEEC and China-Central Asia frameworks. Activities such as the Silk Road E-commerce Platform of the Brand and Quality Online Shopping Festival and the Quality African Products Online Shopping Festival have yielded substantial results, and virtual country pavilions help partner countries to export their high-quality specialty products to the Chinese market. The innovative Cloud Classroom program has provided livestreamed training sessions for more than 80 participating countries to reinforce their digital literacy. Through consistently enriching the content and elevating the level of cooperation, Silk Road E-commerce has become a new platform for bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation and a new strength in high-quality BRI cooperation. The construction of the Belt and Road Initiative Space Information Corridor has been a resounding success. China has built teleports connecting South Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The data from remote sensing satellites under the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) program is widely used in multiple countries and fields. The BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS-3) provides comprehensive services for China-Europe Railway Express, and in maritime transport and other fields. China and a number of BRI partner countries and regions have combined to develop and launch communication or remote sensing satellites, and constructed satellite ground stations and other space infrastructure. Through the Regional Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (China) affiliated to the United Nations, China has trained a large number of space professionals for partner countries. Together with other countries and regions, China has built the China-GCC Joint Center for Lunar and Deep Space Exploration, the China-UAE Space Debris Joint Monitoring Center, the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Center for Earth Observation Data, the China-ASEAN Satellite Remote Sensing Application Center, and the China-Africa Cooperation Center on Satellite Remote Sensing Application. The CNSA-GEO platform, the Belt and Road Analysis and Early Warning Platform for Typical Meteorological Disasters, and the Natural Resources Satellite Remote Sensing Cloud Service Platform now serve many partner countries. IV. Injecting Positive Energy into World Peace and Development Over the past decade, BRI cooperation has witnessed remarkable results. It has opened up new space for world economic growth, built a new platform for international trade and investment, reinforced the development capacity of relevant countries and improved people's lives, sought ways to improve the global governance system, and brought greater certainty and stability to a world fraught with turbulence and change. The BRI has boosted China's development and benefited the rest of the world. 1. Bringing tangible benefits to participating countries Development is an eternal theme for humanity. The BRI has focused on the fundamental issue of development, addressing the weaker links and bottlenecks that hinder development, building new engines for economic development, and creating a new development environment and space for participating countries. This has strengthened their confidence and their capacity for development, and improved their people's lives. The initiative has contributed to addressing global development imbalance and advancing modernization in all countries. Boosting development in participating countries. Over the last 10 years, the BRI has addressed the major bottlenecks restricting connectivity and economic growth in most of the developing countries. A large number of infrastructure projects have been built, with significant progress for participating countries in the construction of railways, highways, pipelines, shipping, energy, communications and other basic public service facilities. This has improved local living and working conditions and the development environment, and boosted their capacity for independent economic development. Some engineering projects with a long construction cycle are like seeds sown in a field, gradually generating comprehensive benefits for the long term. Connectivity in infrastructure has effectively reduced the cost for countries to participate in international trade, increased their access to the global economy, and stimulated the potential and impetus for their development. Research by the Asian Development Bank shows that lowering a landlocked country's trade costs by 10 percent through improvement in infrastructure could increase its exports by 20 percent. Industrial capacity cooperation has promoted industrialization, digitization, informatization, and the structural upgrading of industries in participating countries. It has helped them to form competitive industrial systems and expand the breadth and depth of their participation in the international division of labor and cooperation, creating more opportunities and greater space for development. China has actively conducted international cooperation in emergency management. It has sent rescue teams to Nepal, Mozambique, Trkiye and other countries to carry out humanitarian operations following earthquakes and floods, and provided emergency supplies and technical support to Tonga and Madagascar, among other countries. Building poverty reduction capacity in participating countries. Developing countries still face the challenge of problems related to food. China has taken an active part in global food and agriculture governance. It has released the Vision and Action on Jointly Promoting Agricultural Cooperation Along the Belt and Road with partner countries, and signed more than 100 agricultural and fishery cooperation documents with almost 90 partner countries and international organizations. Its trade in agricultural products with BRI partners has reached US$139.4 billion. China has sent more than 2,000 agricultural experts and technicians to over 70 countries and regions, and introduced more than 1,500 agricultural technologies such as Juncao and hybrid rice to many of these countries. It has helped with rural poverty reduction in Asia, Africa, the South Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean, developing modern agriculture and helping to increase farmers' incomes. Boosting employment is an important element of poverty reduction. In the process of BRI cooperation, China has helped to construct industrial parks with participating countries and provided guidance for Chinese enterprises to create jobs for local residents through high-level industrial cooperation. The jobs provided to locals have helped to lift their families out of poverty. A McKinsey survey revealed that Chinese firms in Africa recruited 89 percent of their employees locally, contributing to local employment in an effective way. The World Bank has estimated that by 2030, BRI-related investments could lift 7.6 million out of extreme poverty and 32 million out of moderate poverty. Panel 3 Juncao poverty alleviation wins worldwide acclaim China's Juncao technology makes comprehensive and efficient utilization of three major agricultural resources  light, heat and water. It makes circular production based on plants, animals, and fungi possible, combines economic, social and environmental benefits, and supports food, energy, and eco-environmental security. Juncao technology was first launched as an official assistance project in 2001, in Papua New Guinea. Over the last two decades, China has hosted more than 270 international training courses on Juncao technology, for more than 10,000 trainees from 106 countries. It has also established Juncao technology demonstration centers or bases in 13 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the South Pacific region. Today, Juncao technology is being applied in more than 100 countries, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs for local youth and women. A former cabinet minister of Papua New Guinea named his daughter Juncao. The people of Lesotho have produced folk songs in praise of Juncao which are still popular today. In 2017, Juncao technology was listed as a key project of the China-UN Peace and Development Fund, contributing more Chinese know-how to the cause of international poverty reduction. Delivering notable results in projects that improve people's lives. Chinese firms have repaired and maintained bridges to make it easier for local residents to travel. They have drilled wells to meet local villagers' needs for drinking water. They have installed street lamps for pedestrians to see clearly on their way home at night. Many such seemingly small projects have solved urgent problems for local people and improved their daily lives. They have brought tangible benefits to the people of participating countries, and increased their sense of gain, fulfillment and security. Over the last 10 years, Chinese firms have launched more than 300 poverty alleviation, health care and rehabilitation, and Happy Home projects in participating countries. They have helped with the construction of the headquarters of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the China-Pakistan Fraternity Emergency Care Center in Gwadar, Pakistan. They have also helped Cameroon, Ethiopia, Djibouti and other countries to provide clean drinking water for the local people. Panel 4 The Sweet Spring Project improves people's wellbeing in the Lancang-Mekong Region In January 2020, China launched the Lancang-Mekong Sweet Spring Project, a project demonstrating rural water supply safety technology in the Lancang-Mekong region. Water supply facilities were built in rural areas of Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, markedly improving local water supply capacity and safety. Through this project, China has helped to improve the lives of local people and played an active role in helping the Lancang-Mekong region to access clean water and sanitation, one of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. As of December 2022, 62 demonstration sites had been built in the project area, ensuring safe drinking water for more than 7,000 local people. China had also trained over 400 personnel from the region in rural water supply management and project management. The Silk Road Community Building Initiative has promoted projects in more than 20 areas, including poverty alleviation and disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, environmental protection, and women's exchanges and cooperation. Related activities have had an extensive impact. 2. Adding vitality to economic globalization Against a rising tide of de-globalization, the BRI is committed to global connectivity and interconnected development. It has further opened up the main arteries of economic globalization, facilitated the flow of information, capital, technology, product, industry and people, and promoted closer and broader international cooperation. By expanding economic globalization and distributing its benefits fairly, the BRI aims to promote global development that is balanced, coordinated, inclusive and shared by all, and that brings win-win cooperation and common prosperity. Boosting the momentum for global development. The BRI has connected the vibrant East Asia economic circle at one end, the developed European economic circle at the other, and the countries in between with huge potential for economic development, and fostered closer economic cooperation with African and Latin American countries. It has formed a new global development dynamic in which the Eurasian continent is fully connected with the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans, and the land is integrated with the sea. It has expanded the scope and coverage of the international division of labor in a broader economic and geographical space, and enlarged the global market, which ultimately promoted new global economic growth. At the same time, through infrastructure connectivity, the BRI has proved a catalyst to international investment and boosted global interest in and enthusiasm for investment in infrastructure, which provides economic growth and rapid development in participating countries. These efforts have effectively addressed the shortage of international public goods and provided sustained impetus for world economic growth. Encouraging deeper regional economic cooperation. In strengthening infrastructure connectivity, the BRI promotes connectivity between countries in many directions and various fields. The BRI turns dots into lines and lines into fields, gradually amplifying the radiation effect of development. It encourages countries to coordinate economic policies, systems and mechanisms, and innovate cooperation models, conduct broader, deeper and closer regional cooperation, and jointly create an open, inclusive and balanced regional economic cooperation architecture that benefits all. It has facilitated a freer and more orderly flow of economic factors, more efficient allocation of resources, and deeper integration of markets, and upgraded economic and trade connectivity and vitality between countries and regions, and the overall position of participating countries in global industry chains, supply chains, and value chains. Participating countries have made full use of their own factor endowments to integrate, coordinate, and upgrade their industry chains, promote industrial complementarity, and improve the efficiency of division of labor. They have broken down trade barriers and market monopolies, unleashed internal and cross-border consumption potential, and expanded the scale of regional markets. Through technology transfer and cooperation in industrial cooperation, they have established technology interaction and interdependence, strengthened capacity for innovation, and promoted leapfrog development. Promoting global trade. The BRI supports the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment by building transport and information infrastructure in a planned and progressive manner. It has eliminated internal, transnational, and inter-regional transport bottlenecks and barriers to trade and investment cooperation, made cross-border logistics and foreign trade easier and more convenient, and increased the efficiency of domestic and international cooperation. It has built up an all-round, multi-level and complex network of unimpeded trade, creating a new dynamic and greatly facilitating global trade. At the same time, the BRI has made participating countries more attractive to quality global capital, and contributed to rising direct cross-border investment in these countries. In 2022, cross-border direct investment inflows in Southeast Asia accounted for 17.2 percent of the global total, 9 percentage points higher than in 2013. The inflow of FDI into Kazakhstan grew by a historical high of 83 percent year on year. World Bank study-""Belt and Road Economics: Opportunities and Risks of Transport Corridors""  estimates that prior to the BRI, the six corridor economies undertrade with each other and the rest of the world by 30 percent on average and they fall short of their absorptive potential of FDI by 70 percent. Transport infrastructure projects under the BRI would reduce trade costs for the world by 1.8 percent, and reduce trade costs along the China-Central Asia-West Asia economic corridor by 10 percent. This has greatly facilitated global trade and boosted economic growth. The study projects that trade growth would range between 2.8 and 9.7 percent for corridor economies and between 1.7 and 6.2 percent worldwide, and global real income is expected to increase by 0.7 to 2.9 percent. Maintaining the stability of global supply chains. An efficient and interconnected international transport corridor established under the BRI framework plays an important role in maintaining the stability and smooth flow of global supply chains. During the Covid-19 outbreak, ports and logistics companies canceled or reduced services for shipping and freight transport, which had dealt a hard blow to those global supply chains which were highly dependent on shipping. Panel 5 China-Laos Railway turns land-locked Laos into a land-linked country The China-Laos Railway is an electrified railway directly connecting Kunming City of China with Vientiane City of Laos. It is the first transnational railway built under the BRI, funded mainly by Chinese investment, operated jointly by the two sides, and connected directly with China's railway network. The 1,035-km-long railway officially opened for business on December 3, 2021. On April 13, 2023, the China-Laos Railway started cross-border passenger services, with bullet trains running directly in both directions between Kunming and Vientiane. As an important part of the central section of the pan-Asia railway network, the China-Laos Railway has helped Laos to realize its long-cherished dream of becoming a land-linked country from a landlocked one. It has promoted transport, investment, logistics and tourism, and injected new impetus into the economic development of Laos and areas along the line. By August 31, 2023, the railway had recorded a total of 20.79 million passenger trips and carried 25.22 million tonnes of cargo. It has become a safe and efficient international passageway connecting Laos with its neighboring countries and regions and generating mutual benefits. The China-Laos Railway is a project that wins the heart of the people and an example of clean management. The leaders of China and Laos reached an important agreement on making the China-Laos Railway a clean project. The discipline inspection and supervision departments of the two countries established a government-level supervision and coordination mechanism, and the enterprises involved in construction had taken incorruptibility as a top priority from project design and deployment through to implementation and review. Effective systems were in place to enforce this principle throughout construction, and new methods of cooperation to fight corruption were tested. Through the efforts of both parties, the China-Laos Railway has become a road of friendship, integrity and happiness. According to a World Bank study  ""From Landlocked to Land-Linked: Unlocking the Potential of Lao-China Rail Connectivity""  the China-Laos Railway could raise Laos\' aggregate income by up to 21 percent over the long term. The transit trade through Laos along the line is estimated to reach 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030, which would include a shift of an estimated 1.5 million tonnes of trade from maritime transport to the railway. As a key output of BRI cooperation, the China-Europe Railway Express effectively sustained rail connectivity on the Eurasian continent, boosted sea-rail, road-rail, air-rail, and other forms of multi-modal transport, and opened up a new transport corridor for the Eurasian continental supply chain. Together with the innovations in customs clearance such as the Customs-Train Operators Partnership for Secure and Expedited Clearance of CR Express Carried Goods (C-TOP), Rapid Customs Clearance for rail service, China made an important contribution to stabilizing the global economy. Several well-known international logistics associations have stated publicly that the China-Europe Railway Express has provided the world with a reliable logistics solution that can effectively alleviate tensions in the global supply chain and strengthen international logistics. 3. Providing new solutions for improving global governance The deficit in global governance presents a severe challenge to the whole world. The BRI supports genuine multilateralism, and cherishes shared growth through consultation and collaboration in global governance. It advocates dialogue rather than confrontation, removing walls rather than erecting walls, integration rather than decoupling, and inclusiveness rather than exclusion. This is a new paradigm for state-to-state relations that shapes the international order towards greater justice and equality. Gaining more recognition for the concept of global governance. The BRI\'s core principles of ""extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits"" have appeared in important documents from international organizations and mechanisms, including the UN and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. The vision of a global community of shared future has developed deep roots. A number of bilateral communities have been built between China and other countries, including Laos and Pakistan. Steady progress has been made in building multilateral communities, including those between China and Africa, the Arab States, Latin America, ASEAN, Central Asia and Pacific Island countries. Practical results have been achieved in building communities in functional areas, including cyber space, maritime cooperation, and health for all. According to the China\'s National Image Global Survey released by the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies in 2020, the BRI is the Chinese proposal with the highest level of acceptance overseas, with more than 70 percent of respondents recognizing the positive impact of the BRI on individuals, states and global governance. European think tank Bruegel released a paper titled ""Global Trends in Countries\' Perceptions of the Belt and Road Initiative"" in April 2023, which noted that the BRI is generally positively received in the world, and Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, exhibit strongly positive sentiment towards the BRI. Improving multilateral governance mechanisms. The BRI upholds the principles of mutual respect and equality, openness, inclusiveness, and win-win results. It enshrines multilateralism by securing international fairness and justice, and protecting the rights and interests of developing countries. The BRI helps improve the existing multilateral governance mechanisms by firmly upholding the authority and status of the UN, and striving to consolidate and strengthen the stature and effectiveness of global multilateral governance platforms such as the WTO. It actively promotes new multilateral governance mechanisms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and works with participating parties to promote governance mechanisms in emerging areas such as the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, internet and artificial intelligence. The BRI has strengthened the position and role of developing countries and emerging economies in the world market system, and increased their discourse power in regional and global economic governance. As a result, the aspirations and concerns of developing countries are increasingly included in the global agenda  a significant improvement in global governance. Innovating and optimizing global governance rules. Taking into account the differences in the level of economic development, factor endowments, and cultural and religious traditions of relevant parties, the BRI has not preset any rules and standards, nor does it draw ideological lines. Instead, it formulates new rules to solve new problems through full consultation and in-depth exchanges, based on the wishes and needs of the parties involved. BRI participating countries seek synergy in their strategies, plans, mechanisms, projects, and rules and standards, which helps to optimize the rules for BRI cooperation, and supports the transition from opening up based on the flow of goods and factors of production to opening up based on rules and related institutions. Some rules and standards with strong potential for universal application have been formulated in this process, which has effectively filled in gaps in the global governance system in these areas. 4. Garnering strength for the progress of human civilization Exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations drive human progress and global peace and development. In contrast to those who persist with black and white thinking, concoct such concepts as the ""clash of civilizations"" and ""superiority of Western civilization"", and provoke large-scale ideological confrontation, the BRI advocates equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness among civilizations, and promotes the shared values of humanity. It has charted a path of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations for all to prosper individually and collectively, in order to achieve closer ties among peoples and link up the cultures and hearts of all countries. Improving the mechanisms for people-to-people exchanges. People-to-people exchanges cover a wide range of areas, including politics, culture, the arts, sports, and education. The global influence of various multilateral and bilateral political party exchange mechanisms has increased with the creation of mechanisms such as the CPC and World Political Parties Summit, and the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-level Meeting. The leading role of high-level inter-party exchanges garners consensus and strengths for stronger people-to-people ties. Various BRI cooperation mechanisms have emerged, including the Silk Road Think Tank Association, the Belt and Road Initiative Tax Administration Cooperation Mechanism, the ANSO, the Belt and Road Health Professionals Development Alliance, the Silk Road International League of Theaters, and the Silk Road International Museum Alliance. The emergence of such mechanisms has facilitated people-to-people exchanges in diverse forms, promoting mutual understanding, mutual respect, and mutual appreciation among the peoples of all countries. China, Kyrgyzstan, Iran and other Central and West Asian countries jointly launched the Alliance for Cultural Heritage in Asia  the first international cooperation mechanism regarding Asian cultural heritage  to protect cultural heritage, the tangible carriers of civilization. The projects under the framework of the alliance, for example the protection and restoration of Uzbekistan's ancient city of Khiva, have been highly commended by UNESCO. Creating quality brand projects and activities. Several projects and activities have become popular and attracted widespread public participation. Examples include the Silk Road (Dunhuang) International Cultural Expo, the Belt and Road/Great Wall International Folk Culture and Arts Festival, the Silk Road International Arts Festival, the Maritime Silk Road International Arts Festival, the Belt and Road Youth Story, and the Tea Road Cultural Tourism Expo. Cultural and people-to-people exchange programs have won wide acclaim, including the Silk Road Community Building Initiative, the Kit of Love of medical supplies, Luban Workshops of technical vocational training, the Happy Spring well-drilling project, the Brightness Journey program of free cataract surgeries, the Panda Pack Project of school supplies, the Amity Torch Program of educational assistance, the Belt and Road Tour of Acupuncture-Moxibustion promoting traditional Chinese medicine therapies, and the Confucius Classroom of cultural exchanges. As these goodwill activities, quality brands, and signature projects continue to emerge, they have become an important means through which all parties can join to strengthen people-to-people ties. This reinforces the sense of identity and belonging of the peoples of all BRI participating countries. Galvanizing the power of youth. The future of the BRI belongs to the youth. Over the last 10 years, young people in participating countries have engaged proactively in people-to-people exchanges and programs that create a better life. The younger generation has galvanized the tremendous power of youth for strengthening people-to-people bonds and realizing common development. Panel 6 Luban Workshops Lu Ban was an ancient Chinese woodcraft master and inventor. The Luban Workshop, an international exchanges platform for vocational education named after the master, has become a well-known Chinese initiative for introducing Chinese vocational education internationally. Luban Workshops are mainly opened in ASEAN, SCO and African countries. The workshops offer a combination of academic education and vocational training, and share the approach, technology, and standards of Chinese vocational education. The project has built training centers, provided advanced teaching equipment, and sent Chinese teachers and technicians to help train technical personnel for participating countries. Since the first Luban Workshop opened in Thailand in 2016, Chinese universities and colleges have established dozens of Luban Workshops with more than 20 participating countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, which offer courses in more than 70 directions, including industrial robots, new energy, and the Internet of Things. The workshops have trained tens of thousands of technical personnel for participating countries, helping more young people to find work. Though small in scale, the workshops respond to people's desire for a better life, and facilitate the realization of the dream of common development. The Chinese Youth Global Partnership has received a positive response from all over the world. More than 100 national youth organizations and international organizations have established ties and cooperative relations with China. Sixteen events of the Belt and Road Youth Story have attracted more than 1,500 young people from participating countries. Focusing on poverty alleviation and reduction, climate change, and pandemic response cooperation, participants shared with the audience their stories and experience in promoting social development and their own development, which vividly demonstrated the right way to view the world from the perspective of appreciation, mutual learning, and sharing. Other successful activities have also taken place, including the Silk Road Incubator Youth Entrepreneurship Program and the China-Central and Eastern Europe International Forum for Young Innovators, which have become important platforms for the youth of participating countries to strengthen friendly exchanges and cooperation. V. Pursuing Steady and Sustained Progress in High-Quality BRI Cooperation Experience over the past 10 years has proved that BRI cooperation responds to the call of the times and benefits the peoples in participating countries. It thus enjoys popular support. It is a path for all participating countries to achieve modernization and a path of hope leading to a bright future. It is resilient and vigorous, and offers broad prospects. Currently, the world is in a period of turbulence and transformation. Rivalry and competition between major countries is escalating; the geopolitical situation remains tense; global economic recovery is yet to appear over the horizon; cold-war and zero-sum mentalities are resurgent; unilateralism, protectionism and hegemonism are proliferating; populism is making a noticeable resurgence. A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation has given rise to ever fiercer competition; the deficit in peace, development, security and governance is growing; foreseeable and unforeseeable risks are rising rapidly around the globe. All of this presents unprecedented challenges to humanity. Certain countries overstretch the concept of national security and seek ""decoupling"" in the name of ""derisking""; they trample international economic and trade order and market rules, and endanger the security and stability of international industrial supply chains; they also impede international humanistic and technological exchanges and cooperation. Their actions raise obstacles to the long-term development of humanity. In a world full of uncertainties and instabilities, all countries should urgently bridge differences through dialogue, oppose rifts with unity, and promote development through cooperation. Against this backdrop, the BRI becomes more meaningful and is an initiative to be welcomed. In the long term, the trends towards multipolarity and economic globalization, the trend of our times towards peace, development, cooperation and win-win outcomes, and the desire of the people of all countries for a better life will remain unchanged. So will the momentum behind the rise of developing countries as a whole and the status and responsibilities of China as the largest developing country in the world. The BRI faces some difficulties and challenges; however, its future is promising, as long as all countries can manage threats, address challenges, and advance cooperation by considering both their own long-term interests and the overall interests of humanity. As a large and developing country that meets its responsibilities, China will continue to promote the BRI as its overarching plan and its top-level design for opening up and win-win international cooperation. It will open up on a larger scale, across more areas, and in greater depth. It will steadily expand institutional opening up with regard to rules, regulations, management and standards, and establish new mechanisms for a more open economy. It will achieve high-quality new development through opening up, and provide new opportunities for the world with that development. China is ready to increase its resource input in global cooperation and do its best to support and help other developing countries to progress faster. It will work to achieve a greater say for emerging economies and developing countries in global governance, and contribute to the common development of all countries. China sincerely welcomes more countries and international organizations to join in cooperation under the BRI, and will support any initiative that can genuinely help developing countries build infrastructure and achieve shared progress, thereby promoting global connectivity and sustainable development. All countries involved in high-quality BRI cooperation are equal participants, contributors and beneficiaries. China is willing to work with all other parties to strengthen confidence, maintain resolve, and advance BRI cooperation in the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. China hopes that all parties can consolidate the foundations, expand the reach, and optimize the projects of cooperation. Working together, all can create new opportunities, seek new drivers, create new space, and share new fruits of development. All can form closer partnerships in health, connectivity, green development, opening up, inclusiveness, innovation and clean government, and all can thereby participate in fruitful BRI cooperation and provide new and powerful impetus for building a global community of shared future. Conclusion The Belt and Road Initiative has given new life to a history of cultural exchanges that dates back more than two millennia, and has inspired more than 150 countries with the zeal to realize new dreams. In the 10 years that have passed since its launch, cooperation under the BRI framework has brought remarkable and profound change to the world and become a major milestone in the history of humanity. The BRI is a long-term, transnational and systematic global project of the 21st century. It has succeeded in taking its first step on a long journey. Continuing from this new starting point, the BRI will demonstrate greater creativity and vitality, become more open and inclusive, and generate new opportunities for both China and the rest of the world. In the future, the BRI will find itself confronted by new difficulties. But as long as all parties involved combine their forces, work together and persevere, we will be able to overcome these problems and raise our extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits to new heights. Cooperation will thrive, and the BRI can look forward to an even brighter future. China stands ready to work with other countries to pursue closer and more fruitful cooperation under the BRI framework, implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity. Our goals are to pass on the torch of peace from generation to generation, sustain development, ensure that civilizations flourish, and build a global community of shared future.

89,The road ahead: Building a community with a shared future through China-Africa cooperation,"('Islamabad', 'CPEC')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202409\06\WS66dacb4da3103711928a68fd.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/06/WS66dacb4da3103711928a68fd.html,"The 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) marks a pivotal moment in the relationship between China and Africa, signifying a new chapter focused on high-quality cooperation and mutual benefit. As the world faces unprecedented challenges in the 21st century, the partnership between China and Africa stands as a beacon of hope and a model for international cooperation. The synergy between China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and Africa's Agenda 2063 presents a powerful force for development, promising prosperity and stability for both regions. This partnership is more than just a bilateral engagement; it is a blueprint for building a community with a shared future for humanity. China's commitment to modernization and reform is a cornerstone of its domestic and international strategy. Over the past few decades, China has undergone a remarkable transformation, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty and emerging as a global economic powerhouse. This experience has given China a unique perspective on development, one that emphasizes the importance of infrastructure, education, technology, and sustainable growth. By sharing this experience with Africa, China is helping to ensure that the continent benefits from similar progress. The BRI, which has become a central element of China's foreign policy, is a key vehicle for this sharing of development experience. Through infrastructure projects, investment in critical sectors, and technology transfer, the BRI is helping African nations build the foundations for long-term economic growth. The 2024 FOCAC Summit has further strengthened this commitment, with new agreements and initiatives aimed at deepening the integration of African economies into the global market. However, China's support for Africa goes beyond economic assistance. The GDI, which emphasizes sustainable development and the sharing of technological advancements, aligns closely with Africa's Agenda 2063, the continent's blueprint for transforming into a global economic force. This alignment ensures that China-Africa cooperation is not just about immediate gains but also about laying the groundwork for a prosperous and sustainable future. As the world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, the unity and cooperation between China and Africa have never been more critical. The 21st century is characterized by rapid technological change, shifting economic power, and growing environmental challenges. In this context, the partnership between China and Africa is not just beneficial but essential for the stability and prosperity of both regions. One of the key areas where China-Africa cooperation can make a significant impact is in advancing sustainable development. The climate crisis is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today, and Africa is particularly vulnerable to its effects. From desertification to rising sea levels, the continent faces a range of environmental challenges that threaten its economic and social stability. By working together, China and Africa can develop innovative solutions to these challenges, from expanding renewable energy infrastructure to promoting sustainable agriculture. Moreover, the partnership between China and Africa is crucial for promoting peace and stability. Many African nations continue to face internal conflicts and external pressures that undermine their development efforts. China's support for peacebuilding initiatives, conflict resolution, and security cooperation is vital for creating the conditions necessary for sustainable development. Through FOCAC, China has committed to increasing its support for African peacekeeping missions, providing training and resources to help African nations address their security challenges. The partnership between China and Africa is also a powerful model for the future of globalization. In recent years, globalization has faced significant backlash, with many countries retreating into protectionism and nationalism. However, the China-Africa relationship demonstrates that globalization can be a force for good when it is based on mutual benefit, respect, and cooperation. By deepening their economic ties, China and Africa are showing that globalization does not have to lead to inequality or exploitation. Instead, it can be a tool for lifting people out of poverty, building infrastructure, and creating opportunities for all. The BRI and GDI, in particular, offer a vision of globalization that is inclusive and sustainable, one that prioritizes the needs of developing countries and ensures that they are full participants in the global economy. Furthermore, the China-Africa partnership is a testament to the power of South-South cooperation. For too long, the Global South has been marginalized in the global economy, with its development needs often overlooked or ignored. However, through initiatives like FOCAC, China and Africa are asserting their place on the global stage, showing that the Global South can lead the way in addressing the world's most pressing challenges. The 2024 FOCAC Summit is more than just a meeting of leaders; it is a milestone in the ongoing effort to build a community with a shared future for humanity. As China and Africa continue to deepen their cooperation, they are not only advancing their own development goals but also contributing to the broader process of global modernization. The road ahead will not be without challenges. The world is facing significant uncertainties, from geopolitical tensions to economic instability. However, the partnership between China and Africa offers a path forward, one that is based on solidarity, mutual benefit, and a shared commitment to a better future. As both regions navigate the complexities of the 21st century, their cooperation will be a cornerstone of efforts to build a more just, inclusive, and sustainable world. By working together, China and Africa can ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared by all, laying the foundation for a community with a shared future for humanity.

[Photo/Xinhua] Editor's Note: China Daily's think tank 'China Watch Institute' issued a report to brief readers about how some individuals and organizations in Western countries rolled out defamation campaign against the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in an attempt to discredit and suppress China. In recent years, manipulated and encouraged by the anti-China forces in the United States, some truth-bending ""academic institutions"", rumor-mongering ""experts and scholars"" and ""amateur actors"" with no moral scruples have created a chain of lies to defame Xinjiang and mislead international public discourse, often through dirty funding, fact-twisting stories and massive smear campaigns. Truth shall not be tainted, the world should not be deceived and narrative about Xinjiang mustn\'t be distorted. The recent reports by independent US news website thegrayzone.com and Australian publication Australian Alert Service, and a series of press conferences held by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have revealed the truth about the fraudulent Xinjiang-related ""databases"" and the so-called ""witness testimonies"" and, with abundant facts and figures, exposed the real mastermind behind them. Let us get to the bottom of what\'s going on and reveal the ins and outs of the lies about Xinjiang. I. As early as in the last century, the United States and other Western countries started to support separatist and terrorist activities in Xinjiang out of geopolitical purposes in order to destabilize China and contain its development.  During the Cold War, British scholar Bernard Lewis concocted the theory of ""arc of crisis"" aiming to fracture countries from the Middle East to India based on ethnic lines to divide the Soviet Union. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the National Security Adviser to President Carter, argued that the United States must prevent the realization of ""the age-long dream of Moscow to have direct access to the Indian Ocean"". The United States then launched Operation Cyclone, which lasted from 1979 to 1989 and cost up to US$630 million each year. Together with Saudi Arabia and Britain, the United States provided funding, equipment and training for Muslim guerrillas fighting against the Soviet Union.  Right after the Cold War ended, the United States and Britain started to use Xinjiang as a leverage to contain China, by supporting separatist and terrorist forces. The neoconservative forces in the US pivoted from the Soviet Union to containing China\'s influence in Central Asia. US and British intelligence agencies supported Pan-Turkism in order to weaken Russia and China and serve their agenda of maintaining a unipolar world. Over the years, there emerged a number of anti-China institutions and extremist groups seeking a state of ""East Turkistan"" or ""independence"" of Xinjiang, including the World Uyghur Congress and the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile. Since 2004, the National Endowment for Democracy has funneled US$8.76 million to Uyghur diaspora groups campaigning against China\'s policies in Xinjiang. The above-mentioned factors have caused the rapid spread of radical ideas in Xinjiang. Terrorists entered Xinjiang from the battlefields in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Some violent terrorist organizations overtly clamored for targeting and attacking Chinese nationals. Between 1997 and 2014, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) frequently plotted and carried out terrorist attacks, which claimed more than 1,000 civilian lives.  The CIA suggested in 2003 that should the US find itself in a crisis or confrontation with China in the future, the option of using the ""Uyghur card"" as a means of exerting pressure should not be taken off the table. Under this strategy, the United States, Britain and their allies, latching on to the Cold War mentality, have directed their intelligence establishments and anti-China scholars to mobilize Uyghur diaspora groups in spinning out misinformation about the so-called severe oppression of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, which was spread by mainstream Western media in a coordinated manner. Here are what they seek to achieve: First, a false impression that Muslims in Xinjiang support ""independence"". This is often done by instigating certain groups to carry out separatist activities to make the public believe people in Xinjiang all want an independent state. Second, the illusion that the ETIM is for peace. Nothing has been said about relevant groups' close ties with Al-Qaida and their violent and terrorist rhetoric. In November 2020, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo even removed the ETIM from the US list of foreign terrorist organizations. Third, the false claim of human rights violations in Xinjiang. Some organizations including Human Rights Watch have fabricated reports on Xinjiang, but their sources are just a small group of extremely anti-China overseas Uyghurs. The baseless accounts in those reports were further hyped up and spread by institutions such as the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).  In January 2017, then US Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard noted that under US law, it is illegal for anyone to provide funding or support for the Al-Qaida, ISIS or other terrorist organizations. However, the US government has long been, directly or indirectly, providing funds, weapons and intelligence support to these organizations through certain countries in the Middle East.  Lawrence Wilkerson, Chief of Staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell and retired US Army Colonel, when speaking at the Ron Paul Institute in August 2018 on the threefold purposes of the US presence in Afghanistan, stated unabashedly that ""the third reason we were there [in Afghanistan] is because there are 20 million Uyghurs [in Xinjiang]. The CIA would want to destabilize China and that would be the best way to do it to foment unrest and to join with those Uyghurs in pushing the Han Chinese in Beijing from internal places rather than external"".  In a video interview in 2015, Sibel Edmonds, a former interpreter with the FBI, talked about how the US had planned and acted to destabilize Xinjiang. She said that ""Xinjiang is the entry artery of energy. We want to, gradually and internally, play the gender card and the race card. For that part of the world, we want to play the minority without land. We say we are going to help them and they are being oppressed, Chinese are gunning them down and torturing them."" The plan of the US is to copy the tactics used in Afghanistan, Ukraine and Iraq to Xinjiang, making an issue out of thin air and exploit it. ""We hope Xinjiang to be the next Taiwan. As Western nations, we never cared about people. That is not within our interest area, unless it can be utilized, capitalized upon to get our objective."" https://citizensparty.org.au/specialreport-xinjiang-anglo-americanssponsor-east-turkistan-campaigns II. Adrian Zenz, by piecing together dubious information, irresponsibly claimed that millions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang are under detention. He is a far-right fundamentalist Christian, who bases his research on radical media reports and speculations.  Zenz is a so-called ""senior fellow for China studies"" with the far-right Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, an organization established by the US government in 1983 and is known for preaching regime change. The Foundation trumpets the ""double genocide"" theory that seeks to rewrite the history of the Holocaust and portrays communism as evil akin to Hitler\'s fascism. Zenz\'s politically-charged research on Xinjiang has been regarded by the Foundation as an important weapon.  The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation is an outgrowth of the National Captive Nations Committee founded by the Ukrainian nationalist Lev Dobriansky. Its co-chairman, Yaroslav Stetsko, was a senior leader of the Bandera faction of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN-B), a fascist militia. Both helped found the World Anti-Communist League, which was described by journalist Joe Conason as ""the organizational haven for neo-Nazis, fascists, and anti-Semitic extremists from two dozen countries"".  Zenz is a Christian evangelical eschatologist who believes that he is ""led by God"" on a ""mission"" against China. He is a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology, the German branch of the Columbia International University of the United States. This University considers the ""Bible [to be] the ultimate foundation and the final truth in every aspect of our lives"", and its mission is to ""educate people from a biblical worldview to impact the nations with the message of Christ"".  Zenz does not truly care about the Muslim community. A search of his Twitter profile returns no tweets concerning the rise of Islamophobia in the West, or US wars and drone strikes against Muslim-majority countries. His only Tweet concerning Muslims that is unrelated to China is a denial that there is a double standard in how violence is judged when committed by whites and by Muslims.  In September 2018, Zenz published an article in the Central Asian Survey journal, claiming that ""Xinjiang\'s total re-education internment figure may be estimated at just over one million."" This conclusion comes from a single report by Istiqlal TV, a Turkey-based Uyghur exile media organization. The report released an unverified table of ""re-education detainee figures"" allegedly ""leaked"" by the Chinese government, according to which a total of 892,000 individuals from 68 counties in Xinjiang had been detained as of spring 2018. The inflated figure was cited from a report by Radio Free Asia (RFA), a US-funded news agency formed by the CIA during the Cold War for anti-China propaganda. In addition, Istiqlal TV is no neutral media outlet. It advocates separatism and attracts various extremist figures. Abdulkadir Yapuquan, leader of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a UN Security Council listed terrorist organization, is a regular guest of it.  By cobbling together dubious sources, Zenz extrapolates an extremely broad estimate ""at anywhere between several hundred thousand and just over one million"". While admitting that ""there is no certainty"" to this estimate, he insisted that it is nevertheless ""reasonable to speculate"". He attempted to shirk responsibilities for the reliability of the numbers. As time moves on, Zenz continued to pump up his speculative estimate of Uyghur detainees. Speaking at an event organized by the US mission in Geneva in March 2019, he stated that ""although speculative, it seems appropriate to estimate that up to 1.5 million ethnic minorities [have been interned in Xinjiang]."" Zenz mentioned his estimate again in a November 2019 interview with RFA, claiming that China has detained 1.8 million people.  Western governments and media have accepted or even propagated the narratives of Zenz, instead of questioning his research based on irresponsible speculations. He became a US-recognized ""pundit"" on Xinjiang and wrote commentaries for mainstream US media outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and Democracy Now!. On 3 December 2019, the US House of Representatives adopted the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, calling on the Trump administration to impose sanctions on China over the alleged internment of over one million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China. Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on 10 December, Zenz took a victory lap of sorts to celebrate the passage of the Act at the Congress, and used the occasion to call for opening up a new front against China and starting a US investigation into ""involuntary labor in relation to Xinjiang."" https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/21/china-detaining-millions-uyghurs-problemsclaims-us-ngo-researcher/ III. The so-called research findings published by Zenz and others are full of blatant data faking and fraudulent claims. They confuse speculation with hard facts, blur the lines between propaganda and academic research, and fabricate anti-China narratives based on ideology.  Zenz\'s ""paper"" on ""forced sterilization"" in Xinjiang was quoted by former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who cited Zenz\'s name and ""paper"" to level his genocide allegation. This ""paper"" was also cited by the Associated Press, CNN and others, who apparently did no reality check at all on his research. The ""paper"" has never been published by any academic journals, or gone through any peer review. It was only released by the Jamestown Foundation founded under the direction of former CIA Director William J. Casey as an extra-governmental channel to pay Soviet dissidents and, in essence, as a front-line tool of the CIA.  Zenz\'s ""research"" based on no academic contexts, and his ""paper"" fraught with loopholes and data misuse, would fail to pass any academic publication review. His ""major finding"" was the claim that in 2018,""80 percent of all net added IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang."" It sounds like 80 percent of China\'s IUD insertions were carried out in Xinjiang. The original source of Zenz\'s claim, the 2019 China Health Statistics Yearbook, shows that the number of new IUD insertion procedures in Xinjiang in 2018 accounted for only 8.7 percent of China\'s total. (The total number of IUD insertion procedures in 2018 nationwide was about 3.77 million, among which about 330,000 were in Xinjiang.) Zenz then coined the phrase ""net added IUD insertions"", and found that the number of ""net added IUD insertions"" in China was around 300,000 (IUD added minus those removed), while the number in Xinjiang was around 239,000. He then concluded that the number of ""net added IUD insertions"" in Xinjiang accounted for about 80% of the national total. According to his logic, and take Henan Province for example, it registered a ""net added IUD insertions"" of 206,000, accounting for 69% of the national total. Adding the percentage of Xinjiang (80%) and that of Henan (69%) would be more than 100%, which makes no sense at all. Through this cunning trick, Zenz got the incendiary figure of 80%, but still he could not make out a good case. He manipulated data to produce a false impression that the majority of women in Xinjiang were forcibly or even compulsively sterilized.  A chart in Zenz\'s ""paper"" claims that new IUD placements in Xinjiang average between 800 and 1,400 per capita each year, which means each woman in the region would have to undergo 4 to 8 IUD insertion surgeries every day. The figures simply make no sense.  Zenz interpreted a photograph as part of an ""effort to enforce the thorough implementation of increasingly intrusive birth control efforts"". But those in the center of the photograph don\'t look like people of childbearing age. As a matter of fact, the photo is taken from an article by China News Service about a local poverty alleviation program in Xinjiang. The two elderly people in the photo were seeing the doctor for free, as part of the free health checkups and medical consultation offered to local residents under the program. The mix-up shows that Zenz either does not understand the Chinese language or knows little about the basic situation in Xinjiang.  In his ""paper"", Zenz tried to distort facts and framed any government spending on public health as part of the ""genocide"" policy, such as the US$5 billion funds provided by the Chinese central government between 2013 and 2017 to support healthcare and family planning programs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. When citing figures to make his argument, Zenz left out data on maternal and infant mortality reduction in Xinjiang. If China were really intending a ""genocide"" against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, there would have been no need to work so hard to reduce maternal and infant mortality.  When a ""scholar"" like Zenz was asked for opinion by public relations companies or think tanks in Washington, no one questioned his qualifications. It was only after an independent media investigation that it was found he didn\'t have the right academic credentials. Zenz blatantly misused data in order to draw biased conclusions about ""genocide"", which were then used by the US government and some of its hardliners to disrupt diplomacy between China and the US. For political elements who want Sino-US relations to deteriorate further, Zenz happened to be of great use.  The academic community in the US is facing tremendous pressure of censorship and self-censorship. Speaking the truth or questioning Zenz's claims in the media often comes with a price. Zenz once threatened to sue Joshua M. Landis, a well-known American expert on Syria, because Landis retweeted an article on the thegrayzone.com exposing Zenz. Landis' tweet was later deleted.  During the Bush administration, the US State Department used the media and Congress to manipulate public opinion and make up a story about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Now on Xinjiang, the same trick is being used to manipulate the media, Congress and even the public.  The US intervention campaign against Xinjiang actually started in the 1990s. The House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, backed by its then chair and Congressman Tom Lantos, a supporter of subverting foreign governments, received some ""Uyghurs in exile"" who made similar testimonies about forced abortion and so on. The organizers of this campaign tried to stop Bill Clinton and his administration from granting China most favored nation (MFN) status, but they failed. https://thegrayzone.com/2021/02/18/us-media-reports-chinese-genocide-relied-onfraudulent-far-right-researcher/ IV. A ""report"" released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in March 2020 claims that ""more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019"". In fact, this ""report"" is full of loopholes and lacks the minimum factual basis.  The ASPI is not an independent, impartial research institute. It receives funding from the Australian Department of Defence, NATO, the US State Department, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and arms producers such as Lockheed Martin from the US.  The lead author of the ""report"" is Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, an anti-China individual who has defended the Falun Gong cult and described Chinese-Australians who oppose the violent rioters in Hong Kong as being ""brainwashed"" by the Chinese government.  The ""report"" is self-contradictory and does not add up. For example, on the one hand, it decries the ""isolation"" of the minority workers who ""speak almost no Mandarin"" and whose ""communication with locals is largely non-existent."" On the other hand, it denounces Mandarin language classes offered to workers as insidious ""political indoctrination"".  The ""report"" presents no original evidence on ""forced laborers"", but cites anonymous ""testimonies"" from an obscure, far-right online blog called ""Bitter Winter"". The blog is a project of the Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR), an Italy-based organization that supported various cult organizations such as Falun Gong, Aum Shinrikyo, and the Church of Almighty God (Eastern Lightning).  The Australian media has suppressed the criticism of the ""report"" and attempted to manipulate public opinion. Shortly after the release of the ""report"", the Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired a program on the lead author, Vicky Xiuzhong Xu. According to a Chinese-Australian interviewed by the program, the interviewer pushed him to praise Vicky\'s research on Xinjiang and made it clear that they were not looking for negative comments. A Chinese Muslim living in Australia revealed that Australian media outlets often attempt to manipulate Chinese-Australians into echoing the official narrative on China, and said that an interviewer from SBS, a television network funded by the Australian government, ""wanted me to confirm her narrative that the Chinese government had operatives following me and were actively suppressing me in Australia"". https://thegrayzone.com/2020/03/26/forced-laborchina-us-nato-arms-industry-coldwar/ V. When the slanderous claims against China were ready for use, instead of verifying their veracity, some Western media outlets rushed to hype them up. To create fake news, the BBC even went so far as to pay for ""evidence"".  Barrie V Veiss, a former British media professional, revealed in detail on social media the entire process of Western media concocting fake news about Xinjiang. He pinpointed an important source of the fake news to be the anti-China activist Adrian Zenz. Zenz, who had initially rejected the BBC invitation to look for ""evidence"" against China, changed his mind after receiving a commission from the BBC.  In July 2019, Zenz tweeted: The BBC commissioned my research. They asked the first time whether it could be done. I said ""no"", too hard, too little evidence. They asked again. I said: ""let me see what I can find"". Well, the resulting findings now total 17,000 words and 163 footnotes.  After Zenz published his so-called ""The Karakax List: Dissecting the Anatomy of Beijing\'s Internment Drive in Xinjiang"", Western media outlets such as CNN, BBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Deutsche Welle rushed to cite the so-called ""conclusions"", without any investigation or verification, to badmouth and spread lies about Xinjiang\'s counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures. Some even tagged their coverage as ""exclusive"" to steal public attention. However, when China released documentaries on fighting terrorism in Xinjiang, these same media outlets all went into silent mode and turned a blind eye.  On 10 February 2021, at the fourth Press Conference on Xinjiang-related Issues co-hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Xu Guixiang, Deputy Director General of the Publicity Department of the CPC Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, commented on BBC\'s habitual practice of fabricating stories and creating troubles on Xinjiang-related issues. ""I had taken an interview by BBC in Xinjiang myself,"" said Xu. ""We showed our greatest sincerity by making the best possible arrangements for their visit. We were open and candid in our conversation, and met all their interview requests. The coverage they produced later, however, completely distorted the facts,"" Xu added. ""Not long ago, the journalists from BBC took videos of the local residents in Aksu Prefecture without their consent. And without interviewing even one Uyghur, they claimed to have obtained solid evidence of \'massive forced labor\' in Xinjiang. What they had was nothing but a few non-live-action satellite images and the so-called reports churned out by anti-China elements. They even publicly pressed foreign companies that have invested and built factories in Xinjiang to pull out their investment.""""Such moves trampled the ethics of journalism, deviated from the principles of objectivity, impartiality and fairness, and ran counter to facts. They have fully exposed BBC\'s vicious intention of spreading lies and rumors against Xinjiang to serve political purpose, and ruined its reputation as a well-known international media outlet.""  On 6 August 2020, ""China Uighurs: A model\'s video gives a rare glimpse inside internment"", a news report edited by BBC Beijing correspondent John Sudworth based on a video clip shot by a drug dealer and several text messages, alluded that the Chinese government held large numbers of Uyghurs in detention camps and put them under torture and abuse. Merdan Ghappar, the man appearing in the video, is a criminal arrested and convicted in accordance with the law for drug trafficking. According to Chinese laws and regulations, it is a normal procedure for him to return to his place of origin and report to local authorities after being released from prison. However, Sudworth purposefully misinterpreted it as the government\'s attempt to send Ghappar into the internment camp. As in other Sudworth-made stories, the report is filled with disinformation such as separation of families in Xinjiang, forced sterilization of Uyghur women, and millions of Uyghurs and ethnic minorities held in internment camps. Citing unverified document urging for repentance and surrender, text messages from Ghappar and radical views of the criminal\'s exiling uncle Abdulhakim Ghappar, pseudo-scholar Adrian Zenz and anti-China elements such as James A. Millward, this ideologically biased report made groundless accusations against China\'s ethnic and religious policies.  On 12 January 2021, The New York Times published Amelia Pang\'s article ""It Took a Genocide for Me to Remember My Uighur Roots"" in its Opinion section. Using her 1/8 Uyghur origin, Pang portrayed herself and her family as victims of the so-called ""genocide"" by the Chinese government. The truth is, Pang has never been to China, yet she claimed that ""China\'s pressured assimilation insurance policies nonetheless reached me"". During her five years of service at The Epoch Times, the mouthpiece of the Falun Gong cult, Pang published at least 17 articles to promote the cult organization and fabricated a large number of exaggerated and unfounded anti-China reports. In October 2020, The New York Times published an article on the true face of The Epoch Times, calling it ""a force in right-wing media"", ""pushing dangerous conspiracy theories"" and ""feed[ing] the online fever swamps of the far right"". Yet only a few months later, the newspaper took a totally different position, which puts its professionalism, authenticity and motives in serious question.  At the webinar ""Genocide in Xinjiang?A Discovery Zoom Panel"", Daniel Dumbrill, a famous Canadian YouTuber, pointed to the inconsistent statements given by a ""genocide survivor"" widely-reported on CNN and BBC in different interviews. It was also found that the Chinese government renewed her passport when she claimed to be under arrest. The date of renewal is the only pixelated information on her passport that appeared in the CNN footage. VI. The Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) is the first organization to propagate that China has detained millions of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang. With the support of the US government, the organization used crude and clumsy research methods and the conclusions produced are seriously flawed.  The CHRD is a Washington-based NGO backed by the US government. It is directly funded by the US government and receives a large amount of financial support from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an organization controlled by the US government to promote regime change. Over the years, the CHRD has been working on behalf of far-right opposition figures who have glorified colonialism and appealed for the ""Westernization"" of China.  In 2018, the CHRD submitted a report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discriminationwhich was often falsely cited by Western media outlets as a UN-authored report. The CHRD claimed that the figures in the report were ""based on interviews and limited data"". But in fact, they interviewed only eight Uyghurs. (The Uyghur population in Xinjiang was 12,718,400 in 2018.) Based on these few samples, the CHRD extrapolated estimates that ""at least 10% of villagers [] are being detained in re-education detention camps, and 20% are being forced to attend day/evening re-education sessions in the villages or townships, totaling 30% in both types of camps"". Then, by applying the estimated ratio to the total population of Xinjiang, the CHRD absurdly concluded that one million ethnic Uyghurs have been detained in ""re-education detention camps"" and two million more have been ""forced to attend day/evening re-education sessions"".  Taking the groundless CHRD report as reliable data, the US government accused China of ""arbitrary detention"" of ""at least 800,000, and possibly more than 2 million, Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps"". Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2018, State Department official Scott Busby stated that this ""is the US government assessment, backed by our intelligence community and open source reporting."" https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/21/china-detaining-millions-uyghursproblems-claims-us-ngo-researcher/ VII. The ""First Independent Report"" on Xinjiang which was widely reported in Western media actually came from an institution funded by a sham university.  In March 2021, the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a self-styled think tank, published the so-called ""first independent report"" on Xinjiang. The report claims that China has breached ""each and every act"" of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in its treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The report and the Institute received extensive coverage by mainstream media outlets such as CNN, The Guardian and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Founded in 2019 and based in Washington D.C., the Newlines Institute purportedly aims to ""enhance US foreign policy based on a deep understanding of the geopolitics of the different regions of the world and their value systems"". Its founder and president once served as a member of the advisory board for the US military\'s Africa Command. Anti-China scholar Adrian Zenz is also on its team.  Tom Fowdy, an Oxford graduate and East Asia specialist, revealed in Chollima Report, a website he runs, that the Newlines Institute is actually a front for the Institute of Islamic Thought, an Islamist neo-conservative organization in the US linked to Egypt's Muslim brotherhood, whose members have pleaded guilty to sponsoring terrorism.  In April 2021, Thore Vestby, former mayor of Norway\'s Frogn municipality, worked with Dutch and Danish scholars and published a special paper titled ""The Xinjiang Genocide Determination As Agenda"" through the Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research. The special paper points out that the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy is highly consistent with the official position of the United States. The institute\'s members who drafted the Xinjiang-related report are anticommunists and anti-China elements who have long been influenced by Christian fundamentalism and extreme conservatism, and the institute\'s independence is suspicious. The timing of formulating and releasing of the report highly coincides with the time when the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of ""genocide"" in Xinjiang. The report blindly backs up Pompeo, but does not give any valuable evidence; there is an obvious bias in the selection of original materials, and it quotes a large number of falsified data and misinterpreted information; a large number of valuable, real information is deliberately ignored by the writers. The report clearly supports the US adopting a hardline foreign policy toward China as well as the use of human rights issues to contain and suppress China, which is seriously inconsistent with the position of the ""Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy"" as a neutral academic institution to seek mutual understanding and peace. The mainstream media in the West have collectively ignored the serious loopholes in the report and rushed to cite it without verification, reflecting that the military industry-media-think tank interest consortium in the United States enjoys a great power, and that the relevant institutions have been completely reduced to accomplices of interest groups.  The Newlines Institute is funded by Fairfax University of America (FXUA), an unaccredited sham university formerly known as Virginia International University. In 2019, state regulators of Virginia found the academic quality and rigor of FXUA\'s online education ""patently deficient"" and the university\'s certificate to operate was almost revoked. Data from the US Department of Education show that between 2020 and 2021, the university has 153 registered students, and its official Twitter account has only 13 followers.  The advisory board of the FXUA is composed of heads of military contractors. The Consolidated Analysis Centers Incorporated (CACI), which was involved in the Abu Ghraib prison incident in Iraq, is one of them.  According to a report carried by Xinhuanet in 2007, lawyers from the US Center for Constitutional Rights note that a group of more than 250 former Iraqi prisoners filed a lawsuit against CACI for torture during interrogation in Iraq. https://thegrayzone.com/2021/03/17/report-uyghur-genocide-sham-university-neocon-punish-china/ https://transnational.live/2021/04/27/%f0%9f%9f%a5-breaking-thexinjiang-genocide-determinationas-agenda/ VIII. The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international separatist network. One of WUC\'s affiliate organizations, the right-wing Uyghur American Association (UAA), advocates a hardline China policy, and believes in violent activities to achieve its goals. The US government has supported and subsidized Uyghur extremist organizations through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). In the name of promoting and protecting Uyghur human rights, these organizations attempt to stoke Western hostility against China, with the aim of subverting China and establishing an ""East Turkistan"" nation-state in Xinjiang.  The WUC is a far-right, anticommunist, ultra-nationalist organization made up of Uyghur separatists in exile; its mission is to subvert China and establish an ""East Turkistan"" nation-state. Headquartered in Munich, the WUC is an international umbrella organization with 33 affiliates in 18 countries and regions, including the Uyghur American Association, the Uyghur Human Rights Project, and Campaign for Uyghurs.  Under its cover as a ""human rights organization"", the WUC is in fact a separatist network funded and directed by the US, and a key organization in Washington\'s attempt at a new Cold War against China. In collusion with the NED and Radio Free Asia (RFA), an anti-China media outlet, the WUC is tightly aligned with Washington\'s foreign policy agenda which seeks to contain and impede the rise of China. Many leading members of the WUC have served in senior positions in anti-China media outlets, including the RFA and Radio Liberty. For example, Omer Kanat, Chairman of the WUC Executive Committee, was RFA's senior editor from 1999 to 2009.  The WUC relies heavily on US funding. Since its inception, the WUC has received support from the NED. Since 2016, the NED has provided the WUC with as much as US$1.284 million, and millions of dollars of additional funding to WUC affiliates. In 2018, NED funding to the WUC and its affiliates reached nearly US$665,000, and in 2019, US$960,000, up by almost 50%. In 2020, the NED boasted that it had given Uyghur groups US$8.758 million since 2004, and claimed to be ""the only institutional funder for Uyghur advocacy and human rights organizations"".  In addition to funding from the NED, the WUC and its affiliates have other means to collect money. For instance, on the WUC website, there is a donation portal allowing two types of donation: one-time donation and monthly recurring donation. One only needs to enter bank card information and the money will go immediately to the WUC.  In recent years, the WUC and its affiliates have used these funds to churn out fabricated stories such as ""alleged concentration camps that detain millions of people"" and ""The Karakax List"" in collaboration with Western media outlets hostile to China. They have worked with pseudo-scholars such as Adrian Zenz to clamor for a new Cold War against China and to label China\'s Xinjiang policy as ""genocide"". And they have called on countries to impose sanctions and boycott China.  Although claiming to be ""peaceful and nonviolent"", the WUC and its affiliates have established connections with the far-right Turkish group Grey Wolves, which has engaged in violent activities from Syria to East Asia. In July 2015, the ETIM instigated large-scale anti-China demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul. Hundreds of demonstrators chanting religious slogans attacked in front of the Topkapi Palace a group of Asian tourists, who turned out to be South Koreans. Devlet Baheli, leader of the Turkish MHP, a party closely connected to the Grey Wolves, defended the attacks with extremely racist comments: ""How are you going to differentiate between Korean and Chinese? They both have slanted eyes."" In August of the same year, the Grey Wolves and ""East Turkistan"" forces carried out a bomb attack at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, Thailand, killing 20 people. The attack was allegedly in retaliation for ""the Thai government\'s decision to repatriate a group of Uyghurs to China"". These ""East Turkistan"" elements were trying to travel illegally through Thailand to Turkey and Syria to join the ETIM or other extremist groups in those regions.  While establishing ties with far-right organizations in Turkey, the main representatives of the WUC called on Turkey to take ""interventionist actions"" against China, similar to what it did in Libya and Syria. Wearing Turkish military uniforms, Uyghur militants released a video on the Turkish side of the Turkish-Syrian border in which they threatened to ""wage war against China"". Some militants held up guns and threatened in the Chinese language to ""kill all the Chinese people"", and then chanted jihadist slogans.  The UAA was founded in 1998 and has received millions of dollars in funding from the NED. In recent years, the UAA has worked closely with Washington and other Western governments to promote hostility toward China. ""The National Endowment for Democracy has been exceptionally supportive of the UAA,"" stated Nury Turkel, former UAA President, in 2006, ""providing us with essential funding"". The goal of the UAA is to exploit Washington\'s support to promote regime change in China. Many important allies of the UAA are anti-Muslim, far-right elements in Washington, including Republican Congressman Ted Yoho, the Family Research Council, as well as the FBI.  While the UAA claims to represent the interests of China's Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, many of its closest allies are in fact anti-Muslim, far-right forces and figures, such as ultra-conservative Republican Congressman Ted Yoho, the Family Research Council that practices Christian fundamentalism, and the FBI that is notorious for spying on American Muslims, deliberately concocting terrorist plots, and entrapping Muslim-American youths. Kuzzat Altay, the current president of the UAA, often makes pro-American and anti-China statements on social media, supporting the launch of a new Cold War against China, applauding the Trump administration's trade and technology war with China, and saying that all countries should treat China as a criminal. During the pandemic, the UAA and members of its affiliate organizations spread far-right rhetoric, incited hatred against Asians, called COVID-19 the ""China virus"", and slandered China as waging a ""virus war"" on the world and ""purposefully, intentionally exporting the virus to cause the pandemic."" On 21 March 2021, organized by the UAA, some US-government-funded Uyghur extremists disrupted a gathering against anti-Asian racism in Washington D.C. They barked anti-China slogans such as ""Wipe out China!"" and drove vehicles adorned with signs bearing slogans such as ""Boycott China"" and ""CCP killed 80 million Chinese people."" Their heckling of anti-racist demonstrators was heavily criticized and widely condemned on social media in the United States. The UAA then tried its best to distance itself from extremism and racism, but refused to retract its slogans such as ""Wipe out China!""  Many key members of the UAA set up a military training organization called ""Altay Defense"" and arranged for US military instructors to conduct weapons training for members of Uyghur separatist movement. The UAA claims that all the training was provided by former US special forces officers, such as James Lang, a US Defense Department weapons trainer and former US Army Ranger who served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Faruk Altay, the head of Altay Defense, is brother of UAA president Kuzzat Altay and nephew of former WUC president Rebiya Kadeer. He is also a right-wing, anti-communist, ultra-nationalist, as shown by his remarks on social media. Participants in Altay Defense training sessions also included UAA's incumbent president Kuzzat Altay and Bahram Sintash, a member of the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), who was a key player in lobbying the US Congress to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019.  The UAA's leadership consists of employees of the US government, Radio Free Asia, and the military-industrial complex. Nury Turkel, former president (2004-2006), co-founded the UHRP with the NED. In 2020, Turkel was appointed a commissioner on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom by Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Rebiya Kadeer, former president (2006-2011), is a longtime figurehead of overseas ""East Turkistan"" forces. Kadeer\'s husband, Sidik Rouzi, worked for US government media outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Under Kadeer\'s leadership, the WUC and the UAA forged close ties with the Bush administration. Ilshat Hassan Kokbore, former president (2016-2019), has worked with Booz Allen Hamilton, a notorious private US military and intelligence contractor, since 2008. Edward Snowden was employed at the firm when he decided to blow the whistle on its invasive, all-encompassing system of mass surveillance. Omer Kanat, former vice president, serves as WUC's Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has a lengthy history of working with the US government, from serving as senior editor of Radio Free Asia's Uyghur Service from 1999 to 2009, to covering the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and interviewing the Dalai Lama for the network. Rushan Abbas, former vice president, is the US National Security Agency\'s favorite human rights activist and became the first Uyghur journalist and Uyghur news anchor when the US Congress funded the establishment of the Uyghur department of Radio Free Asia in 1998. She went to the United States in 1989 to study genetic engineering. After graduation, she married a Turkish-American and stayed in the United States, and was later employed by the CIA. She often boasted in her biography of her ""extensive experience working with US government agencies, including Homeland Security, Department of Defense, State Department, and various US intelligence agencies"". She served as a ""consultant at Guantanamo Bay supporting Operation Enduring Freedom"" during the Bush administration\'s so-called war on terror. Following a disastrous publicity appearance on Reddit\'s ""Ask Me Anything"" Q&A forum, during which participants blasted Abbas as a ""CIA Asset"" and US government collaborator, she has attempted to scrub her biographic information from the internet. Abbas currently heads the Campaign for Uyghurs, a WUC affiliate organization. The current leadership of the UAA includes: President Kuzzat Altay. Nephew of Rebiya Kadeer, Kuzzat Altay is fervently anti-communist and pro-US. He is known to have glorified the ""East Turkistan"" separatist movement, comparing it to the founding of the State of Israel. Secretary Elfidar Iltebir. Her sister, Elnigar Iltebir, was appointed under the Trump administration as Director for China in the White House National Security Council. Their father, Ablikim Baqi Iltebir, worked for US government-funded media outlet Radio Free Asia from February 2000 to August 2017. Treasurer Arslan Khakiyev. Khakiyev worked for Radio Free Asia for 18 years. His wife, Gulchehra Hoja, has been with Radio Free Asia since 2001.  In 2004, the NED helped the UAA to found the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), and became its primary funder. Between 2016 and 2019 alone, the NED granted the UHRP US$1.2447 million. UHRP-affiliated projects such as Advocacy and Outreach for Uyghur Human Rights and Advocating for Uyghur Human Rights through Artistic Interaction have also received considerable funding. The UHRP has brought in main leaders of the WUC such as Nury Turkel and Omer Kanat. Many holding senior management positions in the NED have joined the UHRP, such as former NED Vice President Louisa Greve, now serving as Director of Global Advocacy for the UHRP. https://thegrayzone.com/2020/03/05/world-uyghur-congress-us-far-right-regimechange-network-fall-china/ https://thegrayzone.com/2021/03/31/china-uyghurgun-soldiers-empire/ IX. The so-called ""Xinjiang Victims Database"" poorly put together by anti-China forces is an ill-motivated and baseless project designed purely for political manipulation. In recent years, anti-China forces have concocted the ""Xinjiang Data Project"", ""Xinjiang Victims Database"" and ""Uyghur Transitional Judicial Database"" by gathering made-up ""witness accounts"" to misrepresent Xinjiang to the world. Research and verification shows that, of the 12,050 names listed in the three ""databases"", 1,342 are simply non-existent. Among the 10,708 real names, 6,962 are people living a normal life; 3,244 are convicted for crimes of endangering public security, violent terrorism or other criminal offences; 238 are dead of causes such as illness, and 264 are living outside China. Here is the truth about some of the much reported cases in the so-called ""databases"".  The first category of those cases involve people who fabricated personal experiences. Some of the ""witnesses"" in the ""databases"" are, in fact, hired by Western anti-China forces. These ""witnesses"" act out the made-up stories to smear Xinjiang abroad and make a living out of it. They choose to be the pawns of Western anti-China forces in exchange for refugee status and material benefits, making up one lie after another about their so-called experience in the vocational education and training centers only to be busted by the truth time and again. 1. Sayragul Sauytbay Sayragul Sauytbay, female, born in 1976, is from Zhaosu County of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China Sayragul Sauytbay claimed to have been an instructor at a ""rehabilitation class"" and accessed classified documents before leaving China, and to be able to prove that 2,500 people were interned where she worked. On 12 December 2019, Sayragul Sauytbay claimed in a video clip released by the BBC that during her days at the ""detention camp"", she had been beaten on the head by an electric baton and her personal freedom was restricted, and that surveillance cameras were installed in all the classrooms, dormitories and bathrooms in the ""camp"". On 4 March 2020, Sayragul Sauytbay received the US State Department\'s annual International Women of Courage Award. Mike Pompeo said at the awards ceremony, ""Today we also honor Sayragul Sauytbay. Formerly a medical doctor, she was separated from her family, tortured, imprisoned, and faced execution because of her courage to simply speak the truth."" On 20 April 2020, Japanese manga artist Tomomi Shimizu drew cartoons telling a story of ""persecution"" from the perspective of Sayragul Sauytbay, picturing her as the ""survivor of re-education camp"". (2) Reality check In April 2016, Sayragul Sauytbay was appointed head of the Central Kindergarten of Chahanwusu Town, Zhaosu County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. On 19 March 2018, she became an elementary school teacher in Chahanwusu. Half a month later, on 4 April, she asked for leave from the school. The next day, she left China illegally. To set the record straight, first of all, Sayragul Sauytbay lied about her experience. She claimed to be a medical-university graduate who had worked as a doctor, but the truth is she only attended nursing course at a vocational school in Ili and has never been a doctor. She initially said she was an instructor at an education and training center, but later claimed to be a victim interned and tortured, subjected to medical experiment and forced to eat pork in the ""concentration camp"". As a matter of fact, she has never worked or studied at any education and training center, still less been subjected to any compulsory measure. Her whole account of the center is nothing but smear and slander. Second, Sayragul Sauytbay is a criminal suspect. On 5 April 2018, she left China illegally carrying a Chinese border pass. Her conduct violated the provisions of Article 322 of the Criminal Law of China on illegal border crossing. In June 2015 and December 2016, she obtained two loans totaling 470,000 yuan from the rural credit cooperative of Chahanwusu Town with forged real estate purchase contract and guarantor's signature and fake documents. To this day, she has yet to repay 398,000 yuan worth of debt. Her conduct violated the provisions of Article 193 of the Criminal Law of China on loan fraud. Due to her criminal offences, she has been listed online as a wanted person by the public security authorities according to legal procedures. Third, Sayragul Sauytbay has a record of dishonest behavior. When she was head of the Central Kindergarten of Chahanwusu Town, she took advantage of her position and appropriated performance bonuses, which hurt the interests of her fellow colleagues. As a result, she was removed from office by the local education authorities in accordance with laws and regulations. Before illegally crossing the border, she talked her younger sister Panar into obtaining a loan worth 45,000 yuan and buying her car, but she never transferred ownership of the vehicle to Panar, much to Panar's resentment. 2. Mihrigul Tursun Mihrigul Tursun, female, born in 1985, is from Qiemo County of Xinjiang. In August 2010, she registered for marriage with an Iranian in China, and in January 2012, with an Egyptian in Egypt. In April 2015, she gave birth to triplets in Egypt. Two of her children were registered for permanent residence in China in October 2015, and another was entrusted to the care of her husband's cousin. On 22 April 2018, Mihrigul Tursun left China with her husband and two children. (1) Activities outside China Mihrigul Tursun went to the United States in April 2018. There, she attended a hearing of the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China as a witness, and gave false testimony citing her so-called ""personal experience"". In her interviews with CNN and other media outlets, she claimed that she was detained by the police in a ""concentration camp"", and was forced to take or get injected with unknown medicines. She claimed that people detained there were suffering from torture everyday, and she herself witnessed the death of nine women. She said that one of her sons died in the Urumqi Children\'s Hospital, and nobody told her why he was admitted for treatment. (2) Reality check First, Mihrigul Tursun was fully free in China except for the 20 days under criminal detention. On 21 April 2017, she was criminally detained by the Public Security Bureau of Qiemo County on suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination. She was confirmed to have infectious diseases. The Bureau revoked the compulsory measures on 10 May 2017 out of humanitarian considerations. Between 2010 and 2017, she made 11 trips between China and countries including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Turkey. Second, Mihrigul Tursun had never studied in any vocational education and training center, nor had she ever been forced to take any medicine. She claimed that the drugs and medicine she was injected with in the ""concentration camp"" caused her infertility. As verified by investigation, there was no sterilization record, and her parents said that she was fertile. She also lied about her younger brother, claiming that he was abused to death in a vocational education and training center. When hearing this, Akbar Tursun, her ""dead"" brother, stated publicly that Mihrigul was a habitual liar, and that she had not only lied about his death, but also rumored about watching others die. Third, Mihrigul Tursun's son did not die when receiving treatment in Urumqi. One of her sons, due to illnesses such as pneumonia, hydrocephalus and right-side indirect inguinal hernia, was taken to Urumqi Children's Hospital by Mihrigul Tursun herself and her family. The boy was hospitalized for treatment from 14 to 19 January, from 6 to 12 May and from 4 to 8 November in 2016. In April 2018, Mihrigul Tursun and her husband left China with this child. 3. Zumrat Dawut Zumrat Dawut, female, born in 1982, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang. She left China in January 2019. (1) Activities outside China Since 20 September 2019, in interviews with Radio Free Asia and other media outlets, Zumrat Dawut claimed to have been interrogated by the public security departments in Xinjiang and detained in a vocational education and training center for reasons including being married to a Pakistani. She alleged that she had been brutally persecuted, forced to take contraceptives with other women detained there, and forced to undergo sterilization with her uterus resected. She also asserted that she was served a pork dish in the Han family that her family was paired up with. On 24 September and 2 October 2019, she attended as a witness and gave false testimony at a panel discussion on ""international religious freedom"" and a seminar on ""human rights crises in Xinjiang"" held by the US State Department. On 12 October, she said that her neighbor in Xinjiang told her that her father had died after multiple rounds of police interrogations. (2) Reality check First, Zumrat Dawut had never studied in any vocational education and training center. This was confirmed by her fifth eldest brother Abduheili Dawut in an interview. Second, Zumrat Dawut had never undergone any forced sterilization. Before she gave birth to her third child in the Urumqi Maternal and Child Health Hospital in March 2013, she had signed a delivery consent form, agreeing to a cesarean section and tubal ligation, and she received the surgeries at the hospital. She never had a forced sterilization, not to mention any hysterectomy. Third, the so-called ""pork dish"" was a sheer fabrication. The paired-up family she referred to is the family of Zhao Qilin, the paired-up family of her fifth eldest brother Abduheili Dawut. In January 2018, Zhao Qilin invited Abduheili Dawut, his wife Horqiz Ahmat and his sister Zumrat Dawut over to his home. Zhao\'s mother cooked for the guests. There is no chance that Zhao\'s mother, an ethnic Hui herself, would ever prepare a pork dish. The two families took a picture when having dinner together. Fourth, Zumrat Dawut's father had never been detained. According to her fifth eldest brother Abduheili Dawut, their father had been living with his children all along, and had never been investigated or detained. Their father passed away due to coronary heart disease. Zumrat Dawut's claim that her father died after police interrogations was a complete lie. 4. Gulzira Auelhan Gulzira Auelhan, female, born in 1979, is from Yining County of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China In an interview with the BBC on 15 January 2020, Gulzira Auelhan claimed that she had been detained for 15 months, during which she was tortured and injected with unknown medicine. She purported that she had worked in a glove factory after being released and had to report to the police on her whereabouts, and that her husband was also under surveillance after he was released. (2) Reality check First, Gulzira Auelhan defaulted on a bank loan. It was found out that she, along with four others in her village as co-guarantors, borrowed 40,000 yuan from the Yining County Rural Credit Cooperative. She never paid back the interest of the loan even after it had matured, and was blacklisted by the bank. Second, she has a record of dishonest behavior. In her interview with The Globe and Mail, she said that her life goal was to bring up her children. Yet facts proved otherwise. She has no biological child, and has been indifferent to her three stepdaughters of her third husband. After she left China, she even asked her stepdaughters to pay her debts. 5. Tursunay Ziyawudun Tursunay Ziyawudun, female, born in 1978, is from Xinyuan County of Ili Prefecture of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China After leaving China on 26 September 2019, Tursunay Ziyawudun had several interviews by the BBC and other foreign media outlets, during which she claimed that women detained at the education and training centers had to either undergo surgical sterilization or take medicine to stop menstruation, and that she was forced to undergo irreversible tubal ligation and sterilization. In an interview with the BBC on 2 February 2021, she said she had ""experienced and seen sexual abuse"". (2) Reality check First, Tursunay Ziyawudun has never had any medical record of contraceptive operation. Second, what she said in the interviews is inconsistent. In an interview with the BBC this year, she said that police at the center knocked her on the floor and kicked her in the abdomen, and she almost passed out. However, in an interview with the American website Buzzfeed last year, she said ""I wasn\'t beaten or abused."" She claimed that she was under house arrest from January to June 2019. But her passport was issued on 13 March 2019, and passports must be applied in person at government agencies. If she were under house arrest, how could she go out to apply for her passport? 6. Rahman Shanbay Rahman Shanbay, female, born in 1987, is from Tekes County of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China After leaving China on 19 December 2018, she was interviewed by The Globe and Mail and other foreign media outlets. She claimed that she was interned in a room with 24 women, and was chained with handcuffs and shackles for one week because the application ""WhatsApp"" was installed on her cell phone. (2) Reality check First, Rahman Shanbay underwent investigation in accordance with the law. She was inquired by local police after being reported to have stored terrorist and extremist audios and videos on her cell phone and watched them frequently. Given the minor nature of her crime, her confession and remorse, she received only admonition as required by law. Second, Rahman Shanbay was never interned. Her mother Danishban Musa said ""my daughter indeed went to a police station and was subjected to inquiry because she was influenced by religious extremism and was suspected of committing a crime. However, she came back only three hours later, and since then she has stayed at home, helping me and my husband take care of the cattle.""  The second category of those cases involve people who fabricated stories about their relatives. Some anti-China individuals staying abroad fabricated lies about their relatives being arrested, persecuted or missing, in an attempt to garner sympathy from the international community and serve their schemes. Such unfounded claims are seriously misleading to the international community. Even their relatives in China have spoken out to debunk their lies. 1. Ferkat Jawdat Ferkat Jawdat, male, born in 1992, is from Yining City of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China After going to the United States on 23 January 2011, Ferkat Jawdat organized ""collective testimony"" in several other countries, pieced together information of trainees at the so-called ""concentration camps"" and led the allegation campaign ""Me Too Uyghur"". He claimed that his mother was detained in a ""concentration camp"" for 12 months and imprisoned for three months. In March 2019, he was ""received"" by Mike Pompeo as one of the so-called ""survivors of internment camps"" and their family members. (2) Reality check Ferkat Jawdat and his father, brother and two sisters live in the United States. His mother Minawar Tursun leads a normal life in China. As Minawar Tursun said, she has video calls with her son almost every day. 2. Kuzzat Altay Kuzzat Altay, whose real name is Kuzzat Mamat, is nephew of Rebiya Kadeer, former head of the World Uyghur Congress. Born in 1984, he is from Urumqi of Xinjiang and now lives in the United States. On 26 October 2019, Kuzzat Mamat became president of the Uyghur American Association. (1) Activities outside China At a press conference at the US Congress held by the Coalition to Advance Religious Freedom in China, an anti-China organization, as well as in interviews since February 2019, he claimed that his father Mamat Qadir was arrested and probably had died. (2) Reality check It has been verified that Kuzzat Altay's father Mamat Qadir lives a normal life in Urumqi. 3. Guljahra Qeyum Guljahra Qeyum, female, born in 1973, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang. She is a journalist and news presenter of the Uyghur language department of Radio Free Asia and a member of the Uyghur American Association. On 8 May 2017, she was listed online as a wanted person by the public security authorities on suspicion of joining a terrorist organization. (1) Activities outside China In July 2018, Guljahra Qeyum attended a meeting of the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China and said that her parents were detained in an internment camp. In March 2019, she was ""received"" by Mike Pompeo as one of the so-called ""survivors of internment camps"" and their family members. (2) Reality check Guljahra Qeyum's parents lead a normal life. Her 79-year-old father Abduqeyum Ghoja suffers from paralysis caused by cerebral infarction. Her mother Chimangul Zikir, aged 73, has several medical conditions including cardiac disease, hypertension and varicose veins in calves, and she needs to take care of her husband at home. They expressed no interest in traveling abroad due to poor health. 4. Yiminjan Sadul Yiminjan Sadul, male, born in 1965, is former associate professor of the History Department of the Xinjiang Islamic Institute. (1) False story by foreign media Yiminjan Sadul\'s daughter Samre Yiminjan claimed that her father was arrested by the authorities in Xinjiang for publishing an Arabic grammar book in 2014, and that she learned in November 2019 that he was sentenced to 15 years\' imprisonment for the ""crime of inciting and advocating extremist ideology"". On 13 February 2020, a Washington Post journalist published an article entitled ""Boston Uighur Woman Champions Her Father\'s Release"", claiming that Samre Yiminjan\'s father Yiminjan Sadul was detained by Chinese officials and arrested over charges of extremism. (2) Reality check It has been verified that Yiminjan Sadul lives a free life. 5. Arpat Arkin Arpat Arkin, male, born in 1997, is from Yining City of Xinjiang. On 29 October 2015, he travelled abroad and joined the World Uyghur Congress. (1) Activities outside China In February 2019, Arpat Arkin tweeted that his mother had been put in a ""concentration camp"" since late 2017, and his father Arkin Tursun was arrested on March 2018 and sentenced to 7 or 11 years in prison. In March 2019, he was ""received"" by Mike Pompeo as one of the so-called ""survivors of internment camps"" and their family members. (2) Reality check Arpat Arkin's mother, younger sister and younger brother are all living a normal life. His father Arkin Tursun was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment by the People's Court for inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination and for cover-up. Arkin Tursun confessed to all the charges and is now in good health and serving his time in prison. 6. Reyhan Asat Reyhan Asat, female, born in 1981, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China On 9 May 2020, The New York Times published an article claiming that Reyhan Asat, a Uyghur in the United States, said in an interview that her younger brother Akbar Asat was arrested in Xinjiang when he returned to China for participating in the activity of the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) held by the US State Department in 2016, and was then sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment by the Chinese government for inciting ethnic hatred. She called on the IVLP organizers to pay attention to this case and urge the Chinese government to release her brother Akbar Asat. (2) Reality check Reyhan Asat's younger brother Akbar Asat was sentenced to 15 years in prison for inciting secession by the People's Court in accordance with the law. He confessed to the charge and is now serving his sentence and is in good health. He was sentenced for violating China's law. It has nothing to do with whether he had participated in relevant activities in the US. 7. Mamut Abdureyim Mamut Abdureyim, male, born in 1978, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang, and is now living in Australia. (1) False story by foreign media Mamut Abdureyim said in a CNN interview that he had ""lost contact"" with his wife Arem Ablat and his children since April 2017, and that he couldn\'t go back to China for fear of his own safety. (2) Reality check Mamut Abdureyim has long indoctrinated his wife Arem Ablat with religious extremist and violent terrorist ideologies. After leaving China on 30 November 2012, she took part in religious extremist activities many times, and incited other people in China to travel abroad to prepare for terrorist activities. On 6 December 2015, tasked by terrorist organizations, Arem Ablat returned to China, where she instigated and coaxed other people into leaving the country to join terrorist organizations abroad and launching terrorist activities. On 19 June 2020, she was sentenced to nine years in prison for instigating ethnic hatred by the People's Court in Kashgar. She is now serving her sentence. Mamut Abdureyim's daughter now lives with his father Abdureyim Mamut and attends the No.1 Primary School of Kashgar. His son lives with his mother-in-law Patima Abdurusul and attends a kindergarten in Kashgar. Mamut Abdureyim has never returned to China to take care of his children and family since he left the country on 14 September 2012.  The third category of those cases involve the so-called ""witnesses"" whose experiences were in fact fabricated. There are a large number of people whose identities have been fabricated, distorted and exploited in the so-called Xinjiang-related ""databases"". For instance, Tayir Asan, a doctor of the Gastroenterology Department of the People\'s Hospital in Kuqa of the Aksu Prefecture; Aysham Sadik, a retired teacher; Gulbahar Mamat, a kindergarten teacher in Zepu County, Kashgar Prefecture; Tayir Talip, a writer and retired editor of Kashgar Daily; Anwar Dawut, Omar Ali and Abdukeyum Dawut in Pishan County, Hotan Prefecture, and so on. All of them were allegedly ""detained"" according to the Western anti-China forces, when, in fact, all of them are living a normal life. Among them, Yilpan Yezmujan, a football player, is training at the Suning football club in Jiangsu Province; Isak Payzulla, an editor of Hami Daily, and the Zaram Talips, retired officials from the Committee of Ethnic and Religious Affairs in Hami, attended in person the fifth press briefing on Xinjiang-related issues on 2 March 2020 to debunk the rumors.  The fourth category of those cases involve people who have been prosecuted on criminal charges in accordance with the law. In the so-called Xinjiang related ""databases"", there are some who were sentenced in accordance with the law for violating China\'s laws. They are by no means the ""victims"". For example, Sami Bary from Turpan was sentenced to life imprisonment for organizing, leading and joining terrorist organizations and for murder; Akbar Yimin from Urumqi was sentenced to 25 years in prison for organizing and leading organized crime of a gangland nature, forced transaction, robbery and unlawful detention; Ahat Wuji from Baicheng County in Aksu was sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempted murder and provocative and disturbing acts; Abdurehman Abdukerem from Zequ County in Kashgar was sentenced to four years in prison for child molestation. It is simply preposterous that the Western anti-China forces should ""cry foul"" for these criminals.

The cases are often based on fabricated or exaggerated information, and the sources cited in each example come from Western media outlets.

Some key features of these cases include:

* Fabricated or distorted information: Many of the examples cited are claimed to be victims of human rights abuses, but in reality, they have been prosecuted for various crimes against their own families, communities, or governments.
* fabricated ""databases"": The sources used to support these claims often appear to be databases created by Western anti-China forces, which have no credible basis in fact.
* Emphasis on ""victims"" vs. ""perpetrators"": These cases often focus solely on the victims and their families, while ignoring or downplaying the perpetrators' actions.

Some specific examples from the text include:

* The fabricated story of a doctor who was supposedly ""detained"" in Xinjiang, when in fact he has been living a normal life.
* A claim about a football player who allegedly helped spread misinformation about Xinjiang-related issues.
* Examples of people being ""suspended"" or ""fired"" from their jobs for alleged crimes against China's laws.

It is essential to approach these claims with a critical eye, recognizing that they often rely on unverifiable sources and may be used as part of a broader campaign to demonize the Chinese government.","The article discusses a wide range of cases involving false or fabricated accusations against people of Uyghur ethnicity living in China, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The author categorizes these cases into three types:

1. **Fabricated testimonies**: These cases involve individuals whose identities and backgrounds are fabricated or distorted to create a false narrative about their alleged involvement in anti-government activities.
2. **Criminal prosecution**: In this category, people are accused of crimes such as terrorism, murder, organized crime, child molestation, and others, often based on manipulated or fabricated evidence.
3. **False confessions**: These cases involve individuals who have been coerced into making false confessions under torture or other forms of psychological manipulation.

The author highlights several examples of these cases, including:

* The ""witnesses"" whose identities were fabricated for the purposes of creating a false narrative about their involvement in anti-government activities.
* People sentenced to life imprisonment for organizing, leading, and joining terrorist organizations, despite having no connection to such activities.
* Individuals accused of crimes such as murder, robbery, and child molestation based on manipulated evidence or fabrications.

The author also criticizes the ""Western anti-China forces"" for ""crying foul"" in these cases, suggesting that they are perpetuating a false narrative about Uyghur ethnicity and the actions of Chinese authorities. The article concludes by emphasizing that these cases do not reflect the reality of human rights abuses committed by China against its own citizens.

The author's analysis highlights the importance of critically evaluating information and sources to avoid perpetuating misinformation, and emphasizes the need for accountability and transparency in investigations and prosecutions."

Riding the momentum of deepening Global South solidarity this year, countries from all over Asia and even beyond have applied to join the grouping, indicating the wide recognition of its more prominent role on the world stage and its growing international clout. With the 16th BRICS summit, which is scheduled to be held in Kazan, Russia, from Oct 22 to 24, drawing near, a number of countries have expressed their desire to join the grouping, demonstrating the mechanism's growing appeal. The upcoming summit in Kazan, themed ""Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security"", will be the first summit after BRICS\' expansion from five to 10 members last year, when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Ethiopia were admitted at the Johannesburg summit as new BRICS members, effective on Jan 1, although Saudi Arabia is yet to complete the formalities to become a full member. On Monday, Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Minister Vijitha Herath said his country is to place on record its request for membership of BRICS at the upcoming Kazan summit, citing the grouping as an effective partnership for mutually beneficial cooperation, peace and development, and inclusive multilateralism. It joins Cuba, Syria, Malaysia, Thailand, Belarus and Pakistan in seeking membership of the grouping, as they have all applied to join it. Russia has already confirmed that along with the 10 members more than two dozen other countries that have applied for or are considering membership will participate in this year's summit. The high number of new applications suggests another expansion of the grouping may be underway. There are some countries that are less than happy that BRICS should prove so appealing. Japan is one such country that has reportedly expressed concerns over Malaysia and Thailand applying to join BRICS. A South China Morning Post article, citing Japanese experts, said Japan is worried that the Southeast Asian nations may be moving away from their balanced diplomacy and leaning toward a grouping largely influenced by China and Russia. Given Japan's role as an Asian mainstay in the Western bloc, which has been fomenting bloc confrontation and seeking exclusive interests worldwide, it is not surprising that many in Japan harbor such a view. To them, BRICS presents a challenge to the Western-dominated international order. In fact, Western countries, including Japan, should grasp the fact that the popularity and strong appeal of BRICS is because of the many injustices in the world order today that BRICS is viewed by countries of the Global South as having the potential to change. Exacerbating these in-built injustices in the global governance system, the Western countries have been sparing no effort to create divisions and confrontations among the countries of the Global South in pursuit of selfish gains. The BRICS mechanism has thrived to become an increasingly important cooperation platform for countries of the Global South because of its spirit of openness, inclusiveness and emphasis on win-win cooperation. Rather than being a means for Beijing and Moscow to exploit some countries' resentment against the United States and its wealthy allies in service to their efforts to overcome the Western countries' endeavors to constrain their development, the still-expanding BRICS grouping is simply a natural manifestation of the dissatisfaction with and determination to challenge the structural advantages in the international system that enable the Western countries to enjoy unfair and exorbitant privileges. But BRICS is not, as Western countries seek to portray, an assault on the global order. Instead, it is a means for the countries of the Global South to pursue measured and incremental changes in the global governance system to shape and build a just and equitable world.",[],[],2024-10-17 20:24,chinadaily.com.cn,"- **Main Topics:**

During the lunch break, a crowd of diplomats gathered for the Art and Tradition of Chinese Medicine Event, organized by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to the UNOG, and the UNOG. The event drew about 200 participants, notably officials from international organizations and diplomats from more than 50 countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Syria, Bangladesh, Georgia, Gambia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kazakhstan and Mauritius. Traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, embodies Chinese cultural values and humanistic spirit, said Chen Xu, China's permanent representative to the UNOG and other international organizations in Switzerland. He stressed the need to promote this cultural heritage and uphold tradition while fostering innovation, with a strong focus on technological advancement to drive the TCM development. Highlighting openness and inclusivity, Chen called for increased cultural exchange and international collaboration as well as learning from global medical practices to boost global health and sustainable development.

93,US heads down wrong road on BRI tactics,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202207\08\WS62c76dcda310fd2b29e6b262.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202207/08/WS62c76dcda310fd2b29e6b262.html,"Experts call for stronger partnership with China rather than copycat moves Copycat moves by the United States to counter the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, will likely fall flat, say observers who instead suggest the country should boost cooperation with China to help it gain stronger partnerships and increased credibility. Leaders of the Group of Seven nations recently launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, during their summit in the Bavarian Alps of Germany, with a declared aim to leverage $600 billion of public and private funds by 2027 for the program. US President Joe Biden pledged $200 billion from his country. The PGII is a rebranding of the Build Back Better World initiative, also known as B3W, which was put forward by the US at a G7 summit in the United Kingdom a year ago, as the West\'s response to ""counter"" the BRI. Pelagia Karpathiotaki, a Greek international relations scholar, said that PGII is really a communication tool to show the global audience that the US is bent on retaining its hegemony, and she believes it is unlikely to materialize. 'Geopolitical tool' While unveiling the B3W, Biden promised that it would help ""meet the enormous infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries"". But it has so far yielded just $6 million in global infrastructure construction, which is a far cry from the billions that the US promised in the original announcement. The B3W was supposed to narrow a $40 trillion gap in infrastructure investment for developing countries. ""It is obvious that the PGII  is another geopolitical tool that aims to intensify decoupling tendencies and is a means to counter the Belt and Road Initiative and China,"" Karpathiotaki said. Karpathiotaki said it is unlikely to come to fruition for various reasons. Today, G7 countries and their societies face huge economic challenges, meaning it will be almost impossible to mobilize state resources for PGII purposes, she said. Indeed, it is extremely difficult to mobilize private resources, since private organizations are motivated by profit, not politics. For Karpathiotaki, the PGII merely serves to show that the US still has the power and resources to design global initiatives after the West's failure to confront Russia. ""The announcement of the PGII may in addition serve as a psychological comfort to the leaders of the G7 countries, giving them the feeling that they are contributing to global affairs,"" the scholar said. ""But it is obvious that developing countries are no longer satisfied with promises, especially when there is an alternative proposal such as the BRI."" In an article titled America Shouldn\'t Copy China\'s Belt and Road Initiative published on the website of the Foreign Affairs magazine on June 22, the US publication said the initiative is ""the wrong approach to competing with China in the developing world"". ""The United States is notoriously bad at investing in and maintaining its own physical infrastructure, so it never made sense for it to try to build infrastructure projects abroad,"" the article said. ""China is better at building, not just domestically but across the globe. Of the 20 largest construction contractors, 14 are in China, six are in Europe, and none are in the United States. ""Rather than trying to beat China at its own game, the United States needs to recommit to a vision of planetary prosperity through global cooperation, openness, transparency, and equal opportunity."" Su Wei, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a recent press conference that nine years after the BRI was proposed, based on the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, fruitful results have been achieved. China has signed more than 200 cooperation documents with 149 countries and 32 international organizations, according to official figures. By May, China's trade in goods with countries involved in the BRI totaled $11.8 trillion, and its nonfinancial direct investment in these countries exceeded $140 billion. Transport corridor A large number of projects have been built and put into operation. For instance, China-Europe freight trains have opened up a new land transport corridor between Asia and Europe, Su said. By May, 55,493 freight train trips had been made between China and European countries, with 4.8 million 20-foot equivalent units of goods being transported. The trains provide strong support for the stability and smooth workings of the international supply chain, Su said. While investing or operating in overseas markets, Chinese companies also have made great efforts to promote economic development and employment. Cambodian PPSHV Expressway Co, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Corporation, hired more than 3,400 Cambodian workers during the construction of a major project, accounting for 79.7 percent of the total number of project employees. The company also provided internships to many university graduates. Romny OM, general director of the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, points to the company's efforts to nurture the technical skills of graduates. ""Through the training model featuring hands-on know-how sharing, local university graduates quickly got used to their work and learned and mastered advanced Chinese construction technologies, laying a foundation for them to work in the Cambodian infrastructure industry in the future,"" he said. In Pakistan, Chinese tech heavyweight Lenovo Group entered the market in 2017 and has since become one of the key vendors supporting the government's digital transformation initiatives. According to figures from the International Data Corporation, Lenovo holds 41.8 percent of the market in Pakistan's small and medium-sized business sector, with a 36.3 percent share of the enterprise segment. ""Besides supporting the government vision, Lenovo is also supporting local enterprises in the country through our portfolio of devices,"" said Mohammed Hilili, general manager for the Gulf region at Lenovo. According to World Bank forecasts, if all BRI transport infrastructure projects are carried out, by 2030, the BRI will generate $1.6 trillion of revenues for the world each year, or 1.3 percent of global GDP. Up to 90 percent of the revenues will go to partner countries, and upper-middle and low-income corridor economies are expected to benefit the most. The BRI could, from 2015 to 2030, contribute to lifting 7.6 million people from extreme poverty and 32 million from moderate poverty. Manjari Chatterjee Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank in the US, wrote in a recent report that BRI projects ""have the potential to contribute to stability in countries that lack infrastructure and connectivity"". The report, titled China and the Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia, said the success or failure of the BRI should be determined by asking two questions. First, do recipient countries view the BRI as a positive Chinese initiative that brings significant benefits, either political or economic? Second, has the recipient country been able to manage the BRI to advance its own domestic agenda? And based on analysis of the projects in specific countries, the Council on Foreign Relations report pointed out that China's BRI has generally been welcomed in many countries, such as Pakistan and Nepal. The US can gain stronger partnerships and increased credibility by actively empowering South Asian countries to assess the BRI's merits and demerits, and supporting alternatives for those that opt out, rather than opposing the BRI wholesale, the report added. Sedat Aybar, professor of economics and finance at the Bahcesehir University in Istanbul, said the BRI has bolstered the living standards of the Turkish people, as more and more Chinese companies have been investing in Turkey, supporting its development, especially in infrastructure, transportation, high technology and banking. Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei have also directly invested in Turkey, generating thousands of jobs, he added.

At a once-in-five-years, high-level meeting held last week to set the tone for the country\'s diplomacy, China\'s top foreign policy makers officially named ""building a community with a shared future for mankind"" as the overarching goal of the nation\'s major-country diplomacy in the new era. To boost awareness of this vision at home and abroad, the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, held on Dec 27 and 28, systematically elaborated for the first time on its connotations by defining its top goals, guiding principle, viable paths and supporting pillars. Xi highlighted this vision on Dec 29 when he greeted Chinese officials attending another major foreign affairs meeting  the annual work conference for envoys based overseas. He asked them to ""fly high the banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind ""and break new ground for the country\'s diplomacy. ""As I speak to you, conflicts are still raging in some parts of the world. We Chinese are keenly aware of what peace means. We will work closely with the international community for the common good of humanity, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and make the world a better place for all,"" Xi said in his New Year address on Sunday. Wang Yiwei, a professor at the School of International Studies and director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, said Xi\'s latest speeches and the signals sent by the high-level meetings show that the vision ""is a natural reflection of China\'s people-centered philosophy when it is approaching the rest of the global community"". This vision ""defends the United Nations-centered international order and international system, it encompasses a wide range of goals set by the UN, and it transcends the narrow perspective of caring only about one country"", he added. Analysts and officials said the vision reflects the Communist Party of China's world view and perception of order and values, and it accords with the common aspiration of people in various countries. In addition, the international recognition of the vision is ever expanding, as it has been incorporated into United Nations resolutions and UN Security Council resolutions. Han Chunlin, China\'s ambassador to Romania, wrote in an article published last month that building a community with a shared future for mankind ""is a successful practice with fruitful results"" and has formed a ""scientific theory system ""over the course of the past 10 years. An official statement from last week\'s Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs explained the vision\'s ""scientific theory system"". The vision\'s goal is to ""build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity"", and the pathway for realizing it is through ""promoting global governance that features extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefit"". Its guiding principle is ""the common values of humanity"", and its fundamental supporting pillar is building a new type of international relations. The statement also said the platform for carrying out this vision is high-quality joint building of the Belt and Road, and the strategic navigation for it comes from efforts to roll out the three global initiatives proposed by Xi in recent years  the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative. Chen Xiangyang, director of the Center for a Holistic Approach to National Security Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said all six aspects of the vision specified at the conference  the goal, pathway, guiding principle, pillars, platform and strategic navigation  constitute a scientific architecture that supports the overarching goal of ""building a community with a shared future for mankind"". ""With these six aspects as a whole, the vision will usher in a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress for the world,"" he added. Staying focused on the Belt and Road Initiative, the platform for carrying out the vision, China has signed BRI cooperative documents with more than three-fourths of countries around the world and with over 30 international organizations. Over the past decade, commodity imports and exports between China and the countries participating in the Belt and Road have grown at an average annual rate of 8.6 percent, and the joint efforts helped lift nearly 40 million people overseas out of poverty, according to the Foreign Ministry. Tep Ngorn, second vice-president of the Senate of Cambodia, said that promoting synergy between the BRI and Cambodia\'s Pentagonal Strategy ""will give a boost to the building of a China-Cambodia community with a shared future with strategic significance, mutual benefits and win-win results"". ""The combination of the two visions will speed up Cambodia\'s development of connectivity infrastructure, logistics, industries, digital technology, energy and agriculture, among other things,"" the Cambodian senator told Xinhua News Agency last month. Muhammad Zamir Assadi, a Pakistani political analyst and a journalist with the Islamabad-based Country Media Group, witnessed what he called ""the incredible success story"" of the BRI\'s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and the two nations\' joint efforts to build a China-Pakistan community with a shared future. The CPEC ""has brought China and Pakistan closer to each other with the physical economic bond of this mega initiative to form a community of indivisible common destiny"", he said. ""Considering the Chinese and Pakistani economic systems, commercial projects related to the CPEC have been operated in a market-oriented way,"" he said, noting that noncommercial projects concerning people\'s livelihood have involved multiple participants and have been implemented through fair competition. Benefits brought by the BRI ""have transformed the socioeconomic landscape of Pakistan, and much more is yet to be generated in the next phase and decade of the CPEC"", he added. zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cn ",[],[],2024-01-05 09:30,ZHANG YUNBI,"- **Main Topics:**

Over the past decades, since the launch of the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, China has achieved tremendous achievements in social and economic development. Due to these reforms, China has successfully transformed into an innovation powerhouse, a manufacturing hub and the second-largest economy in the world. It has established a strong ecosystem with complete industrial, physical and digital infrastructure systems. Now, China's reform and opening-up has entered into a crucial stage. China has shifted its focus to high quality and eco-friendly development. Its attention is now on producing more high-tech and intelligent products. Its high-tech industries including new energy vehicles, 5G and photovoltaics are highly competitive and are enjoying a strong growth all over the world. I recently joined a trip with a group of foreign journalists from different countries to East China's Jiangsu province and witnessed the region's rapid high-quality economic and social development. We visited most vibrant cities of the province including Nanjing, Yangzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou and obtained a deep insight into Jiangsu's rich history, culture and high-quality development and its journey toward modernization and innovation. During the trip, I saw how deep-rooted governance guided by the Communist Party of China is bringing prosperity, happiness and welfare to the people. The vital improvement can be observed in the all spheres of life in the province due to the innovation and modernization. Jiangsu, located in the Yangtze River Basin, was the cradle of civilization in ancient China. Historical and ancient cultural heritage is well protected, promoted and presented with the application of modern technologies. It is covered with a dense network of lakes and rivers and reservoirs. Specialty produce, including high-quality rice and seasonal fruits and vegetables, is grown and cultivated throughout the province. It also harvests fish, shrimp, crabs, shellfish, seaweed, and other seafood on a massive scale. Jiangsu has made significant strides in constructing a modern industrial system, with advancements in both industrial base upgrading and industrial chain modernization. According to the official data, Jiangsu's high-quality manufacturing development index reached 91.9, ranking first in China. In 2023, Jiangsu recorded a regional GDP of 12.82 trillion yuan. The per capita GDP surpassed 150,000 yuan, and the number of its cities with a regional GDP exceeding 1 trillion yuan increased to five. Total imports and exports reached 5.25 trillion yuan. Jiangsu is making heavy investment in research and development, accounting for about 3.2 percent of regional GDP in 2023. Furthermore, the number of invention patents per 10,000 people reached 62.1. These figures indicate Jiangsu's commitment to innovation. The province boasts over 51,000 high-tech enterprises with technology contract turnover exceeding 460 billion yuan. Jiangsu has achieved great success in rural and urban revitalization. It now has the most modern and strong high-tech industrial base. Induction of 5G, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies have made the industrial system most efficient and competitive. These achievements show Jiangsu's firm resolve in application of new quality productive forces to create most innovated products and services. Jiangsu's cities are actively promoting ecofriendly development and wellbeing of the people by taking concrete steps. Nanjing, the capital of the province, has become a significant birthplace of modern industry in China. Its four pillar industries, namely steel, petrochemicals, automobiles, and electronics greatly contribute to the local and national economy. Yangzhou, which is renowned for its picturesque beauty and livable environment, is a glowing illustration of green development. The city boasts a green coverage rate of nearly 45 percent in its built-up areas. Its rice, fruits and tea is famous due to unique and delicious tastes. Since 1990s, Yangzhou's industry has flourished in eight major sectors including automobiles, shipbuilding, chemicals, garments, diesel engines, containers, air conditioners, and other specialized industries are driving its economic growth. Wuxi is also renowned for its economic prowess, recognized as one of the birth places of China's national industry and commerce. Wuxi actively fosters the development of cutting-edge industries such as the Internet of Things, integrated circuits, and biomedicine. While, Suzhou, renowned as the city of gardens, embraces openness and international cooperation, which is evident from its various platforms for foreign engagements including the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, the China-Japan Local Development Cooperation Demonstration Zone and others. Jiangsu, being an intersection point of the Belt and Road Initiative, is also promoting cooperation to achieve win-win results. It carried out 262 new investment projects in countries along the BRl. The import and export value solely among countries involved in the BRI reached $223 billion in 2022. Pakistan's cooperation with China including with Jiangsu is also increasing under the BRI in different sectors. Pakistan will focus on enhancing and modernization of the industrial sector during the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is considered an important pillar of the BRI. It is hoped that Pakistan's cooperation with Jiangsu in the industrial sector will also increase in future. Pakistan can learn from China experience to modernize its industrial sector. Pakistan can further enhance cooperation with Jiangsu in the areas of agriculture, textile, culture and education sectors for win-win results.

Also, the Chinese leader's call for strengthening APEC's role in the global economy will help advance greater regional economic integration and connectivity, they said. Jasna Plevnik, president of Geoeconomic Forum Croatia, noted that Xi said that China is ready to bolster the building of an ""interconnected paradigm"", and that Xi\'s address at the APEC economic leaders\' meeting, which took place late last week in Lima, Peru, has reduced the space for uncertainties in international relations, which is highly needed at this moment for the future of regional and global economic cooperation. As the world is facing new waves of unpredictability and protectionism, Xi has urged APEC economies and the global community at large to meet the challenges, take each other as partners in global trade, pursue cooperation in advanced technologies and support each other, she added. ""That approach captures the spirit of the modern times and interests of people."" Swaran Singh, a professor of international relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, said China has been increasingly recognized as the flag-bearer for global growth and economic globalization. Xi's reiteration of China's commitment to economic globalization is reassuring for China's economic partners and for the future of multilateralism in general, Singh said. Ukeru Magosaki, director of the East Asian Community Institute of Japan and a former senior official at Japan's foreign ministry, said that with the impending return of the Donald Trump administration, unilateralism and protectionism are expected to gain momentum in Washington through trade policies, marking a departure from the post-World War II trend of fostering an open global economic system centered on mutual development. ""China\'s future trade policies will significantly influence the global economy,"" he said. ""From a broader perspective, the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated not only to develop through mutual cooperation but also serve as a key driver of economic globalization."" Dicky Budiman, a scholar associated with Australia\'s Griffith University and Indonesia\'s YARSI University, said the president\'s speeches ""inspire optimism for a collaborative pathway toward sustainable development and regional stability, creating opportunities for nations to thrive together while addressing the global challenges of our time"". Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-civilization Research and Development, in Pakistan, said Xi's speeches can be summarized in five words: inclusivity, green development, connectivity (digital and traditional), innovation, and cooperation. The president assured the world that China is committed to strengthening global cooperation for the inclusive and people-centric green transition, enhancing connectivity, and sharing the dividends of technological development by building fair cooperation mechanisms, the expert said. To achieve the objectives, President Xi said that China is deepening reforms and opening-up, creating more avenues of cooperation and partnerships, Ahmad noted. Interconnected growth James Gomez, regional director at the Bangkok-based Asia Centre, said the latest APEC meeting focused on trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth. In terms of promoting sustainable development through innovation, China, as the world's second-largest economy, should further play a leading role in expanding free trade, he said. Brian Renwick, a British business adviser who was a Hong Kong-based consultant to public and private sector organizations for 28 years, said he was glad to see China playing such a large role in the APEC meeting. ""There is no doubt that China\'s approach to cooperation, both regionally and globally, is outstanding,"" he said. ""With the world population rising by three times in just the last 50 years, there is not only space for a multipolar world, but it is essential for global prosperity and security,"" he said. Mehmood Ul Hassan Khan, executive director of the Islamabad-based Centre of South Asia and International Studies, said openness, transparency, fair, free and equitable economic cooperation, is a must for greater development, integration, progress, and prosperity.

From July 2 to July 6, Xi attended the 24th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in the Kazakh capital Astana and paid state visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The visits will accelerate the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative and promote regional development in various fields, analysts said. The focus of Xi's meetings with Central Asian leaders was the implementation of the BRI, a project that enhances trade, infrastructure investments, as well as technological cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, said Sergey Suverov, an associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation. ""The BRI will boost trade between the participating countries, increase GDP dynamics and create additional jobs. Central Asian countries can also leverage their advantageous geographical locations on transit corridors to enhance their economic potential,"" Suverov said. Oleg Timofeev, an associate professor at Russia's RUDN University, said forming transcontinental transport corridors is a focal point of regional cooperation since the launch of the BRI in 2013. Central Asian political circles have been exploring ways to integrate the BRI with local infrastructure projects such as Kazakhstan's Nurly Zhol (Bright Road), Timofeev said. Pritchin Stanislav, an expert at the Primakov Readings Forum and head of the Central Asia Sector at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow, said China has emerged as the main trading partner and investor for most Central Asian countries, significantly boosting economic ties with them. The advancement of China's technologies and education will positively influence the development of Central Asia, Stanislav said. A common home On Thursday, Xi delivered a speech at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Plus meeting in Astana, calling for building a common home of solidarity, peace and tranquility, prosperity and development, good-neighborliness and friendship, as well as fairness and justice. The speech highlighted the necessity of mutual learning and exchange among civilizations, pointing to the potential for collective growth and understanding, said Khalid Taimur Akram, executive director of Pakistan Research Center for a Community with Shared Future. The SCO has been a beacon of international cooperation and a driving force for global development, and its success lies in its adaptability to global changes through solidarity and cooperation, ensuring a prosperous and peaceful future for humanity, Akram said. Tahir Farooq, editor-in-chief of Daily Ittehad Media Group and Pakistan Economic Net, highlighted the speech\'s pivotal points of global significance. ""His emphasis on stability, cooperation and mutual development resonates deeply with the current geopolitical climate. ... His speech reiterated the importance of multilateralism, stressing the need for a fair and just international order and advocating for reforms in global governance structures to ensure they are more inclusive and representative of all nations,"" Farooq said. Xi's call for collective action on various fronts, from economic development to climate change, underscores the interconnectedness of global challenges and the need for a unified response, he added. Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, said that unlike some Western-led groups, the SCO advocates non-alliance and nonconfrontation, and does not target any third party, which should be cherished in a world facing increasing confrontations and conflicts. ""The success of the SCO is a testament to the common aspirations of various countries to pursue a more just and equitable global governance and build a prosperous and peaceful world,"" he said. Anthony Moretti, an associate professor of the Communication and Organizational Leadership Department at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania, described the ""common home"" as a place where friendship and sincerity permeate all conversations.

The latest edition of the fair featured a round table on modern agricultural development within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. This is the first time that all 26 SCO countries  including nine member states, 14 dialogue partners, and three observer nations  participated in the fair, said Liu Zhongshan, deputy director of Yangling's management committee. The participation of all SCO countries in the fair to discuss major agricultural issues is of great significance for deepening international agricultural cooperation, said Nuran Niyazaliyev, SCO deputy secretary general. The SCO, he added, has always prioritized exchanges and cooperation in agriculture within its framework, which is crucial for ensuring food security. The growing participation of both new and returning global exhibitors has highlighted the increasing internationalization of the Yangling fair. Mohammad Amir, head of the handicrafts section of Pakistan pavilion, this year's guest country, made his debut at the Yangling expo for the first time, presenting a range of traditional crafts. Amir said he hoped the expo would help Pakistani products gain recognition and facilitate their entry into the Chinese market. Through the fair, Pakistan aspires to learn from the Yangling demonstration zone and Shaanxi in critical technological areas, including agricultural innovation, high-tech applications within the sector, high-yield seed cultivation and more, as the platform provides an invaluable opportunity for the country to engage with distinguished experts in China, said Khalil Hashmi, ambassador of Pakistan to China, during the Pakistan pavilion inauguration ceremony last week. The Netherlands, a long-time participant at the fair, marked its tenth year of attendance this time. ""This year, the Dutch delegation consists of 16 companies and organizations, the largest number so far,"" said Hu Xizhe, an agricultural adviser at the Dutch embassy in China. Hu added that the Netherlands has showcased advanced agricultural technologies and equipment, including smart greenhouse design, horticulture and livestock lighting, tomato breeding, fruit sorting and orchard management data platforms at the fair. In addition, after 31 years of development, the Yangling expo has expanded its reach beyond China's borders, hosting overseas exhibitions in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for the second consecutive year. The latest overseas exhibition opened on Oct 16, featuring a range of agricultural innovations and products. New apple varieties and specialty fig products from China, for example, garnered attention from local farmers and business representatives. ""The apples from Shaanxi taste great. I grow apples on my farm too, and I\'m interested in learning more about these new varieties in the hope of introducing them back home,"" said Makhmudov Abduvakhob, a grower from the Syrdarya region of Uzbekistan during the expo.

100,Young tech-savvy remote workers vitalize villages,"('Pakistan',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\15\WS6736778fa310f1265a1cd708.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/15/WS6736778fa310f1265a1cd708.html,"KUNMING — In the village of Dazhifang, at the foot of the Cangshan Mountain in Dali, Yunnan province, the aroma of coffee drifts through the courtyard of a homestay called Black Persimmon. Teng Yan is typing away in the communal area, reveling in the perks of a commute-free remote-work lifestyle. ""A month's rent in Beijing can get me a place in Dali to live in for over half a year,"" Teng says, adding that he appreciates the value and tranquility of his new way of life. Teng is a typical modern-day nomad — or what most people call a digital nomad. Sick of four years of his nine-to-five job routine as a programmer, he boarded a flight to Dali in 2022 with his expertise and a laptop. ""Although the company I work for is registered in Beijing, my colleagues are everywhere, in Tokyo, Japan, and Chiang Mai in Thailand,"" he says. Each Sunday, he convenes a virtual gathering with his colleagues to strategize the week's agenda, and for the remainder of the week, they act on their own. While remote working in Dali, Teng frequently travels elsewhere in search of inspiration, leaving footprints in the likes of Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan. ""As digital nomads, we enjoy the freedom to work from any locale with an internet connection, and the mobility afforded by transportation networks enhances our flexibility,"" he adds. Since the 1980s, it has been common for people in remote rural areas to move to big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in search of work. However, in recent years, the young generation has begun to move against the current, flocking to the vast rural area to set up home. This reverse migration is backed by sound infrastructure, an extensive and interconnected modern transportation system and advanced digital technology. The nomadic lifestyle is taking root not only in Dali, but also in many other rural locations in southwestern China. Over the past few years, Renli village in the Sichuan Basin has welcomed a number of new young residents. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2021, Ke Yu returned to China in 2023 and began looking for a place to establish a digital nomad community. While browsing online, a photo of a sightseeing platform in Renli village caught her attention. From the bird's-eye view, the spiral design of the platform resembled a lollipop. ""I didn't expect that in such an inconspicuous village, there would be such distinctive architecture, where the rural atmosphere and modern design are cleverly integrated,"" Ke says. In early January, Ke decided to settle in the village after liaising with the authorities. ""Not far from the platform there were already three finished buildings. With just a little modification, they could be turned into a community comprising spaces for offices, accommodation, dining, entertainment and social functions,"" she says. Renli village's proximity to the Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, which is only a 20-minute drive away, is a significant advantage in luring more digital nomads, she adds. In April this year, the international digital nomad community in Renli village officially began operations, and within half a year, over 380 digital nomads have settled there. One of them is Choo Ho-jin from the Republic of Korea. Coming with a ""why not give it a try ""perspective, he soon decided to stay, signing a 10-year agreement with the community operators. Digital nomads are known for a travel-based lifestyle, and those coming to Southwest China were initially drawn to the region's natural beauty and lower living costs. However, their arrival has introduced not only a fresh way of living but also a subtle transformation of the local landscape. ""The digital nomads are very talented. Some of them are market-savvy. Some are tech experts or marketing wizards,"" Teng says. ""Even though we're in the countryside, we're still aware of the latest information in the metropolises. If we have good ideas or projects, we can gather a few like-minded individuals and bring them to life."" Longshan village near the city of Anning, 35 kilometers from the main urban area of Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan, was once populated mostly by elderly people. With the development of rural tourism, however, it has also become a popular destination for digital nomads. To date, it has hosted 86 digital nomads from more than 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan and Russia. Li Erniu, the founder of a technology company, came to Longshan village in August this year to work remotely while preparing for a marathon. During his daily jogs, Li discovered that the villagers were struggling to sell their walnuts. He stepped in to assist with his marketing talent and soon sold 1,000 kilograms of nuts online. More and more digital nomads are coming to Longshan village, giving a new look to this once obscure, underdeveloped spot. Now, the village boasts a cafe, open-air rest areas, leisure facilities and cozy office spaces. While digital nomads relish the beautiful scenery and low-cost living, villagers also enjoy a better life through thriving tourism.
