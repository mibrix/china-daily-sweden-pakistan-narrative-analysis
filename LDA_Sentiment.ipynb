The goal of the \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\" is to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and the Democratic People\\\\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) . But such an assumption is absurd given China\\\\'s long-standing policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons and minimum deterrence. The US has long rejected China\\\\'s call for pledging no-first-use. According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June, the US and Russia have more than 1,770 deployed nuclear warheads each, and their respective nuclear inventory exceeds 5,000, accounting for 90 percent the world's total. It's hard to believe that even three decades after the end of the Cold War, the two countries refuse to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal and continue to pose a grave threat to the existence of humans. The US' intention is clear: To maintain its nuclear supremacy in order to maintain its global hegemony. To achieve that goal, the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 and pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. One year before that, in 2018 to be precise, the US quit the Iran nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Barack Obama administration when Biden was the vice-president. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. But once he entered the Oval Office, he forgot all about it. \\\"An unforced error\\\", that\\\\'s how some Democratic opinion leaders described Biden\\\\'s promise, or his refusal to honor it. Such irresponsible US actions have triggered widespread concerns even among many US allies in Europe. In 2011, the US-led NATO bombed and instigated a regime change in Libya by abusing a United Nations Security Council resolution on no-fly zone. That too happened when Biden was the vice-president and years after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had given up his nuclear program. It had a chilling effect on countries such as the DPRK, which for long have worried about US military aggression, not least because they see the hundreds of US military bases in the Asia-Pacific as a direct threat to them. Once I asked a senior US official, who was part of the US team that participated in the non-proliferation talks in the 1990s, if he could think of a scenario in which the US would use nuclear weapons. His answer was an instant \\\"No\\\". But Biden seems to believe that annihilation of all humans is still possible. Biden's secret China-targeted plan should not come as a surprise. Back in June, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is mulling increasing the number of nuclear weapons to counter the alleged threat from Russia and China. The \\\"China threat\\\" theory has been hyped up by Washington and its puppets in a bid to justify the US\\\\' monstrous military budget of $916 billion in 2023, more than the combined defense budgets of the next 10 countries or more than three times that of China. The \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\" would likely trigger a global arms race. It may also prompt China to strengthen its minimum deterrence strategy to prevent the US and NATO from blackmailing it or any other country by threatening to launch a nuclear war. Back in 2010, Obama initiated the Nuclear Security Summit, which was endorsed by then Chinese leaders. But Biden has been busy dividing the world instead of uniting it against nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation. War and peace have become a key subject of debate in the US presidential race, as evidenced from the speeches of politicians such as Jill Stein, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. So the international community should pressure the US into reducing its nuclear arsenal and pledging no-first-use. The international community should also renounce Biden's new saber-rattling nuclear strategy.

With wide ethnic diversity, China's cross-country skiers qualified in all 12 disciplines for the first time at the Olympics in Beijing. Uygur skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang, then 20, qualified in four events, the most on the women's side. A native of Altay in Xinjiang she stole the show at Beijing 2022's opening ceremony by lighting the Olympic caldron together with Nordic combined athlete Zhao Jiawen. The inclusion of skimo in the Olympics is opening the door wider for skiers who wouldn't have been discovered otherwise, said Li Wenmao, manager of China's ski mountaineering national program. \\\"We needed some special talents, especially kids who were born with a connection to nature and are not afraid of hard work. Tough conditions are part of the sport The new program has opened up a window for them to be seen by us and by the world,\\\" Li said during a recent media symposium at the team\\\\'s training base in Beijing. \\\"On top of their adaptation to altitude in alpine sports, kids we selected from Xizang and Xinjiang have grit and resilience within them. This is perhaps a bigger driver, in my opinion, for them to withstand all the tough challenges to succeed,\\\" said Li, who is a former mountain climber.\",\n          \"The top Chinese leader has been reiterating the importance of innovation in development and has now highlighted the key role of new quality productive forces in facilitating high-quality development. Although in the past, the relatively slow progress of science and technology in China almost became Achilles' heel for development, the country today has made remarkable achievements in almost every science and technology field. In 2021, China became the leading country in filing applications for new patents. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, China's intellectual property office received 1.59 million patent applications (out of a total of 3.4 million filed worldwide in 2021). It was followed by the US, Japanese, Republic of Korea and European patent offices. China led the field in 2022 and 2023, too. China was ranked 12th in the 2023 Global Innovation Index, becoming the only middle-income country to break into the top 15. Needless to say, it ranked No 1 among middle-income economies. Also in 2023, for the first time China topped the list of countries with the highest number of science and technology clusters, having 24 in total. The United States and Germany followed with 21 and nine clusters respectively. China is now a leader in many cutting-edge technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, financial technology, 5G, as well as electric vehicles, robots and drones. It is also one of the world's largest investors in and users of digital technologies. With a strong venture capital industry focusing on fostering advanced digital technologies and innovations, China is home to one-third of the world's unicorns (start-ups with a value of over $1 billion). As such, innovation is no longer the \\\"Achilles\\\\' heel\\\" of the economy; instead, it has become Pegasus and is carrying China toward modernization. How does that help the world? China\\\\'s unique economic philosophy of win-win cooperation, the opposite of the West\\\\'s zero-sum game in which \\\"the winner takes all\\\", is based on sharing the fruits of its modernization and innovations with other countries. As the global leader in railways, port, bridge and tunnel construction technology, China has been sharing it with Belt and Road partner countries. This shows the mutually beneficial nature of the Belt and Road Initiative which has enabled China to build some of the best infrastructure in the developing world  the first high-speed railway in Indonesia, the China-Laos high-speed railway, the Lekki deep seaport in Nigeria and the magnificent Peljesac Bridge in Croatia, to name but a few. By developing clean technologies, Chinese companies are helping many countries, including European Union member states and non-Belt and Road countries, to transition to green development. A large percentage of the electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, and critical minerals used in clean technology and digital industries in the US and the EU are imported from China, which has become the global leader in this field. China, which also leads in space exploration, is helping many countries place Earth-observing and telecommunications satellites in orbit and has invited all countries to benefit from its space program. Interestingly, a report by the United States Institute of Peace published in September 2023 said Beijing has made support for the development of African countries\\\\' space programs a key incentive for the continent to establish closer ties with China. \\\"By contrast\\\", it added \\\"although US federal agencies and universities are actively involved in research partnerships with some African countries, space technology has not been a focus of US foreign policy in Africa.\\\" Speaking at the China-Africa Leaders\\\\' Dialogue on Aug 24, 2023, in Johannesburg, the top Chinese leader said China was committed to promoting the modernization of Africa. Accordingly, China launched the \\\"Initiative on Supporting Africa\\\\'s Industrialization\\\" to boost Africa\\\\'s manufacturing sector and help the continent realize industrialization and economic diversification, and the \\\"Plan for China Supporting Africa\\\\'s Agricultural Modernization\\\" to expand the grain growing areas, and encourage Chinese companies to increase investment in Africa\\\\'s agriculture sector and strengthen cooperation with Africa.

Tone and Style:**\\nThe overall tone of the article is critical, with a hint of skepticism towards US President Joe Biden's decision to pursue a \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\". The author uses emotional language, such as \\\"insane act of provocation\\\" and \\\"grave threat to the existence of humans\\\", to convey their disapproval. However, there are also instances of neutrality and objectivity.\\n\\n**2. Implied Motives:**\\nThe article appears to be motivated by a desire to expose Biden's reckless decision-making and its potential consequences. The author frames Biden as an irresponsible leader who is prioritizing his own interests over global security concerns. Additionally, the use of euphemistic language, such as \\\"maintaining nuclear supremacy\\\" and \\\"blackmailing countries\\\", suggests that the article is seeking to discredit or criticize Biden's policies.\\n\\n**3. Subtle Implications:**\\nThe article implies that the US has been increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, particularly since the end of the Cold War. The mention of NATO's involvement in Libya and the alleged threat from China suggests that the author believes the US is seeking to expand its military presence and influence globally. The use of loaded terms, such as \\\"China threat\\\", also implies a sense of alarm or fear.\\n\\n**4. Intended Audience Impact:**\\nThe article appears to be intended to instill fear or doubt in the reader about Biden's decision-making process and its potential consequences for global security. The author aims to create a sense of unease by highlighting the US's increasing nuclear arsenal, aggressive military actions, and alleged threats from other countries.\\n\\n**5. Summary:**\\nIn 3 sentences:\\n\\nThe article accuses President Joe Biden of making an \\\"insane act of provocation\\\" with his decision to pursue a \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\", which allegedly aims to prepare the US for coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea. The author argues that this move is driven by a desire to maintain nuclear supremacy and expand US military presence globally, without fully considering its potential consequences. By framing Biden's policies as a threat to global peace, the article seeks to criticize his decision-making process and instill fear in readers about the US's role in international affairs.\",\n          \"**Tone and Style:**\\nThe tone of the article is neutral, with an emphasis on objective reporting. The language used is formal and descriptive, suitable for a news article.\\n\\n**Implied Motives:**\\nThe implied motive behind the article appears to be to promote China's ambition in involving 300 million people in ice and snow sports leading up to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The article highlights China's efforts to discover and develop talent in cross-country skiing, emphasizing the need for \\\"special talents\\\" and \\\"kids who were born with a connection to nature and are not afraid of hard work.\\\"\\n\\n**Subtle Implications:**\\nThe article subtly implies that China's inclusion of skimo (also known as snowboarding) in the Olympics is an attempt to capitalize on the country's vast ethnic diversity and provide opportunities for developing talent. The use of phrases such as \\\"tough conditions are part of the sport\\\" suggests that China's success in cross-country skiing may be due, at least in part, to its ability to adapt to challenging environments.\\n\\n**Intended Audience Impact:**\\nThe article is intended to instill trust and confidence in China's ski mountaineering program, particularly among young athletes. The language used is positive and optimistic, suggesting that the program has made a significant impact on Chinese development sport.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nA talent recruitment campaign was launched by China ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics as part of its ambitious plan to involve 300 million people in ice and snow sports leading up to the event. The inclusion of cross-country skiing and skimo is seen as key factors in discovering and developing talent, with the program's manager attributing success to a combination of natural ability and hard work.\\n\\n**Analysis in 1-2 sentences:**\\nThe article reports on China's efforts to develop talent in ice and snow sports through its talent recruitment campaign, highlighting the country's ambition and commitment to inclusivity. The tone is neutral, with an emphasis on objective reporting and positive language aimed at promoting trust and confidence in Chinese development sport.\",\n          \"**1. Tone and Style:**\\nThe overall tone of the article is informative, optimistic, and slightly critical. The author's style is formal, objective, and persuasive, with a mix of rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \\\"China led\\\") and vivid metaphors (\\\"Pegasus\\\" vs. \\\"Achilles' heel\\\").\\n\\n**2. Implied Motives:**\\nThe implied motives behind the article are:\\n\\n* To promote China's development philosophy of win-win cooperation\\n* To persuade readers that China is a leader in innovation and technology\\n* To argue for China's role as a global leader in infrastructure, space exploration, and clean technologies\\n\\nWord choice and framing of ideas support these motives, such as using terms like \\\"innovation\\\" and \\\"win-win cooperation\\\" to promote a positive image of China.\\n\\n**3. Subtle Implications:**\\n\\n* Loaded terms: \\\"Achilles' heel\\\" (negative connotation), \\\"mutually beneficial nature of the Belt and Road Initiative\\\" (positive framing)\\n* Euphemisms: \\\"shared the fruits of its modernization\\\" (instead of saying \\\"divided by competition\\\")\\n* Suggestive phrasing: \\\"instinctively recognizing China's unique economic philosophy\\\" implies that readers should trust Chinese leaders' intentions\\n\\n**4. Intended Audience Impact:**\\nThe article is intended to inspire readers to embrace China's development philosophy and recognize its benefits, particularly in the areas of innovation and infrastructure.\\n\\n**5. Summary in 1-2 sentences:**\\nChina has made significant achievements in science and technology, becoming a global leader in fields like big data, artificial intelligence, and electric vehicles.

The goal of the \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\" is to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) . But such an assumption is absurd given China's long-standing policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons and minimum deterrence. The US has long rejected China's call for pledging no-first-use. According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June, the US and Russia have more than 1,770 deployed nuclear warheads each, and their respective nuclear inventory exceeds 5,000, accounting for 90 percent the world's total. It's hard to believe that even three decades after the end of the Cold War, the two countries refuse to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal and continue to pose a grave threat to the existence of humans. The US' intention is clear: To maintain its nuclear supremacy in order to maintain its global hegemony. To achieve that goal, the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 and pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. One year before that, in 2018 to be precise, the US quit the Iran nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Barack Obama administration when Biden was the vice-president. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. But once he entered the Oval Office, he forgot all about it. \\\"An unforced error\\\", that's how some Democratic opinion leaders described Biden's promise, or his refusal to honor it. Such irresponsible US actions have triggered widespread concerns even among many US allies in Europe. In 2011, the US-led NATO bombed and instigated a regime change in Libya by abusing a United Nations Security Council resolution on no-fly zone. That too happened when Biden was the vice-president and years after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had given up his nuclear program. It had a chilling effect on countries such as the DPRK, which for long have worried about US military aggression, not least because they see the hundreds of US military bases in the Asia-Pacific as a direct threat to them. Once I asked a senior US official, who was part of the US team that participated in the non-proliferation talks in the 1990s, if he could think of a scenario in which the US would use nuclear weapons. His answer was an instant \\\"No\\\". But Biden seems to believe that annihilation of all humans is still possible. Biden's secret China-targeted plan should not come as a surprise. Back in June, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is mulling increasing the number of nuclear weapons to counter the alleged threat from Russia and China. The \\\"China threat\\\" theory has been hyped up by Washington and its puppets in a bid to justify the US' monstrous military budget of $916 billion in 2023, more than the combined defense budgets of the next 10 countries or more than three times that of China. The \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\" would likely trigger a global arms race. It may also prompt China to strengthen its minimum deterrence strategy to prevent the US and NATO from blackmailing it or any other country by threatening to launch a nuclear war. Back in 2010, Obama initiated the Nuclear Security Summit, which was endorsed by then Chinese leaders. But Biden has been busy dividing the world instead of uniting it against nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation. War and peace have become a key subject of debate in the US presidential race, as evidenced from the speeches of politicians such as Jill Stein, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. So the international community should pressure the US into reducing its nuclear arsenal and pledging no-first-use. The international community should also renounce Biden's new saber-rattling nuclear strategy.

With wide ethnic diversity, China's cross-country skiers qualified in all 12 disciplines for the first time at the Olympics in Beijing. Uygur skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang, then 20, qualified in four events, the most on the women's side. A native of Altay in Xinjiang she stole the show at Beijing 2022's opening ceremony by lighting the Olympic caldron together with Nordic combined athlete Zhao Jiawen. The inclusion of skimo in the Olympics is opening the door wider for skiers who wouldn't have been discovered otherwise, said Li Wenmao, manager of China's ski mountaineering national program. \\\"We needed some special talents, especially kids who were born with a connection to nature and are not afraid of hard work. Tough conditions are part of the sport The new program has opened up a window for them to be seen by us and by the world,\\\" Li said during a recent media symposium at the team's training base in Beijing. \\\"On top of their adaptation to altitude in alpine sports, kids we selected from Xizang and Xinjiang have grit and resilience within them.

The goal of the \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\" is to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and the Democratic People\\\\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) . But such an assumption is absurd given China\\\\'s long-standing policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons and minimum deterrence. The US has long rejected China\\\\'s call for pledging no-first-use. According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June, the US and Russia have more than 1,770 deployed nuclear warheads each, and their respective nuclear inventory exceeds 5,000, accounting for 90 percent the world's total. It's hard to believe that even three decades after the end of the Cold War, the two countries refuse to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal and continue to pose a grave threat to the existence of humans. The US' intention is clear: To maintain its nuclear supremacy in order to maintain its global hegemony. To achieve that goal, the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 and pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. One year before that, in 2018 to be precise, the US quit the Iran nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Barack Obama administration when Biden was the vice-president. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. But once he entered the Oval Office, he forgot all about it. \\\"An unforced error\\\", that\\\\'s how some Democratic opinion leaders described Biden\\\\'s promise, or his refusal to honor it. Such irresponsible US actions have triggered widespread concerns even among many US allies in Europe. In 2011, the US-led NATO bombed and instigated a regime change in Libya by abusing a United Nations Security Council resolution on no-fly zone.

According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, China's intellectual property office received 1.59 million patent applications (out of a total of 3.4 million filed worldwide in 2021). It was followed by the US, Japanese, Republic of Korea and European patent offices. China led the field in 2022 and 2023, too.

This shows the mutually beneficial nature of the Belt and Road Initiative which has enabled China to build some of the best infrastructure in the developing world  the first high-speed railway in Indonesia, the China-Laos high-speed railway, the Lekki deep seaport in Nigeria and the magnificent Peljesac Bridge in Croatia, to name but a few.

Tone and Style:**\\nThe overall tone of the article is critical, with a hint of skepticism towards US President Joe Biden's decision to pursue a \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\". The author uses emotional language, such as \\\"insane act of provocation\\\" and \\\"grave threat to the existence of humans\\\", to convey their disapproval. However, there are also instances of neutrality and objectivity.\\n\\n**2. Implied Motives:**\\nThe article appears to be motivated by a desire to expose Biden's reckless decision-making and its potential consequences. The author frames Biden as an irresponsible leader who is prioritizing his own interests over global security concerns. Additionally, the use of euphemistic language, such as \\\"maintaining nuclear supremacy\\\" and \\\"blackmailing countries\\\", suggests that the article is seeking to discredit or criticize Biden's policies.\\n\\n**3. Subtle Implications:**\\nThe article implies that the US has been increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, particularly since the end of the Cold War. The mention of NATO's involvement in Libya and the alleged threat from China suggests that the author believes the US is seeking to expand its military presence and influence globally. The use of loaded terms, such as \\\"China threat\\\", also implies a sense of alarm or fear.\\n\\n**4. Intended Audience Impact:**\\nThe article appears to be intended to instill fear or doubt in the reader about Biden's decision-making process and its potential consequences for global security. The author aims to create a sense of unease by highlighting the US's increasing nuclear arsenal, aggressive military actions, and alleged threats from other countries.\\n\\n**5. Summary:**\\nIn 3 sentences:\\n\\nThe article accuses President Joe Biden of making an \\\"insane act of provocation\\\" with his decision to pursue a \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\", which allegedly aims to prepare the US for coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea. The author argues that this move is driven by a desire to maintain nuclear supremacy and expand US military presence globally, without fully considering its potential consequences. By framing Biden's policies as a threat to global peace, the article seeks to criticize his decision-making process and instill fear in readers about the US's role in international affairs.\",\n          \"**Tone and Style:**\\nThe tone of the article is neutral, with an emphasis on objective reporting. The language used is formal and descriptive, suitable for a news article.\\n\\n**Implied Motives:**\\nThe implied motive behind the article appears to be to promote China's ambition in involving 300 million people in ice and snow sports leading up to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The article highlights China's efforts to discover and develop talent in cross-country skiing, emphasizing the need for \\\"special talents\\\" and \\\"kids who were born with a connection to nature and are not afraid of hard work.\\\"\\n\\n**Subtle Implications:**\\nThe article subtly implies that China's inclusion of skimo (also known as snowboarding) in the Olympics is an attempt to capitalize on the country's vast ethnic diversity and provide opportunities for developing talent. The use of phrases such as \\\"tough conditions are part of the sport\\\" suggests that China's success in cross-country skiing may be due, at least in part, to its ability to adapt to challenging environments.\\n\\n**Intended Audience Impact:**\\nThe article is intended to instill trust and confidence in China's ski mountaineering program, particularly among young athletes. The language used is positive and optimistic, suggesting that the program has made a significant impact on Chinese development sport.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nA talent recruitment campaign was launched by China ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics as part of its ambitious plan to involve 300 million people in ice and snow sports leading up to the event. The inclusion of cross-country skiing and skimo is seen as key factors in discovering and developing talent, with the program's manager attributing success to a combination of natural ability and hard work.\\n\\n**Analysis in 1-2 sentences:**\\nThe article reports on China's efforts to develop talent in ice and snow sports through its talent recruitment campaign, highlighting the country's ambition and commitment to inclusivity. The tone is neutral, with an emphasis on objective reporting and positive language aimed at promoting trust and confidence in Chinese development sport.\",\n          \"**1. Tone and Style:**\\nThe overall tone of the article is informative, optimistic, and slightly critical. The author's style is formal, objective, and persuasive, with a mix of rhetorical devices such as repetition (e.g., \\\"China led\\\") and vivid metaphors (\\\"Pegasus\\\" vs. \\\"Achilles' heel\\\").\\n\\n**2. Implied Motives:**\\nThe implied motives behind the article are:\\n\\n* To promote China's development philosophy of win-win cooperation\\n* To persuade readers that China is a leader in innovation and technology\\n* To argue for China's role as a global leader in infrastructure, space exploration, and clean technologies\\n\\nWord choice and framing of ideas support these motives, such as using terms like \\\"innovation\\\" and \\\"win-win cooperation\\\" to promote a positive image of China.\\n\\n**3. Subtle Implications:**\\n\\n* Loaded terms: \\\"Achilles' heel\\\" (negative connotation), \\\"mutually beneficial nature of the Belt and Road Initiative\\\" (positive framing)\\n* Euphemisms: \\\"shared the fruits of its modernization\\\" (instead of saying \\\"divided by competition\\\")\\n* Suggestive phrasing: \\\"instinctively recognizing China's unique economic philosophy\\\" implies that readers should trust Chinese leaders' intentions\\n\\n**4. Intended Audience Impact:**\\nThe article is intended to inspire readers to embrace China's development philosophy and recognize its benefits, particularly in the areas of innovation and infrastructure.\\n\\n**5. Summary in 1-2 sentences:**\\nChina has made significant achievements in science and technology, becoming a global leader in fields like big data, artificial intelligence, and electric vehicles. The country is promoting its development philosophy through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to foster mutual growth and cooperation with partner countries.\\n\\n**Concise Output for Topic Modeling:**\\n\\n* Tone: Informative, optimistic, slightly critical\\n* Style: Formal, objective, persuasive\\n* Implied Motives: Promote China's development philosophy, persuade readers of its benefits\\n* Subtle Implications:\\n\\t+ Loaded terms and euphemisms to promote positive image\\n\\t+ Suggestive phrasing to imply trust in Chinese leaders' intentions\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article_body\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 173,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"US President Joe Biden's approval in March of a highly classified nuclear strategy that is aimed at countering the \\\"China threat\\\", first exposed by The New York Times' David Sanger on Aug 20, is an insane act of provocation, and a threat to the world peace. The goal of the \\\"Nuclear Employment Guidance\\\" is to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) . But such an assumption is absurd given China's long-standing policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons and minimum deterrence. The US has long rejected China's call for pledging no-first-use. According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June, the US and Russia have more than 1,770 deployed nuclear warheads each, and their respective nuclear inventory exceeds 5,000, accounting for 90 percent the world's total. It's hard to believe that even three decades after the end of the Cold War, the two countries refuse to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal and continue to pose a grave threat to the existence of humans. The US' intention is clear: To maintain its nuclear supremacy in order to maintain its global hegemony. To achieve that goal, the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 and pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. One year before that, in 2018 to be precise, the US quit the Iran nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Barack Obama administration when Biden was the vice-president. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. But once he entered the Oval Office, he forgot all about it. \\\"An unforced error\\\", that's how some Democratic opinion leaders described Biden's promise, or his refusal to honor it. Such irresponsible US actions have triggered widespread concerns even among many US allies in Europe. In 2011, the US-led NATO bombed and instigated a regime change in Libya by abusing a United Nations Security Council resolution on no-fly zone. That too happened when Biden was the vice-president and years after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had given up his nuclear program. It had a chilling effect on countries such as the DPRK, which for long have worried about US military aggression, not least because they see the hundreds of US military bases in the Asia-Pacific as a direct threat to them.

On Nov 16, the first group of nine international student correspondents from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQPT) began their roles at a traditional Chinese event held at Chongqing Cotton Mill Yard in Shapingba district. The student correspondents come from the United States, Russia, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. They will write about their time in China and convey their perspectives through various media platforms. The program is a collaboration between CQPT, the Publicity Department of Shapingba district, and the China Daily Chongqing Bureau. The event featured a cultural experience centered around the \\\"Start of Winter\\\", the first solar term of the winter season. The students participated in traditional tea ceremonies, learned how to brew tea over a stove, and tried their hand at flower arranging. Chongqing, a megacity in southwest China with a population of over 32 million, serves as a gateway to inland China and is a major manufacturing hub. It became China's fourth municipality in 1997, after Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Spanning an area as large as Austria and five times the size of Beijing, Chongqing has experienced rapid development, transforming into a modern, cosmopolitan city with advanced transportation systems and impressive architecture. While its futuristic skyline of skyscrapers reflects the city's progress, Chongqing, with its 3,000-year history, also preserves a distinct culture and lifestyle. Global perspectives This combination of modernity and tradition makes Chongqing the ideal place for international students to tell their stories about China. Ly Hoang Anh, a graduate student from Vietnam, is excited to become a correspondent documenting her studies and life in the city. \\\"Actually, my childhood dream has always been to become a journalist. This is an interesting job that allows me to explore not only the landscapes of China but also its local life. I hope to have a meaningful experience, find happiness, and gain a deeper understanding of China,\\\" she said. Rucker Andrej Tavon from the US is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and enjoys exploring the city. \\\"I feel a deep passion about my life here in China, and I\\\\'d love to share it with others around the world, especially in my home country,\\\" he said. Garayev Atajan from Turkmenistan said his five years in China have been \\\"a journey of growth, filled with valuable experiences\\\" that have shaped both his academic and personal life. \\\"[Being a correspondent] allows me to share my perspective as an international student and promote cultural exchange between nations,\\\" he said. \\\"I aim to showcase the richness of Chinese culture  its traditions, festivals, and values  and how they connect with people from other cultures.\\\" tanyingzi@chinadaily.com.cn\",\n          \"A trilateral intergovernmental agreement on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project was signed at a ceremony in Beijing on June 6. President Xi Jinping, President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev hailed the event as a sign of unity and shared progress. In his address, President Xi underscored the railway project as an epitome of strategic cooperation within the Belt and Road Initiative. The signing of the agreement establishes a robust legal foundation for the project and signifies a major shift from a mere vision to a tangible reality. China's dedication to collaborating with the two Central Asian countries to accelerate the construction of this strategic transport corridor is a clear indication of the collective progress of the project, which is set to bring substantial benefits to all three countries. The governments of China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan agreed to embark on constructing the new railway at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit held in the Uzbek city of Samarkand in September, 2022. The project feasibility study was updated following the completion of field surveys by Chinese engineers in December last year. All three countries have diligently prepared for the construction, which is expected to commence later this year. The new railway, a beacon of hope and optimism, will start in China's Kashgar and traverse Torugart, Kosh-Dobo, and Kazarman in Kyrgyzstan, culminating in Andijan in eastern Uzbekistan. It is estimated that the railway will shorten the route between China and Europe by about 900 kilometers and reduce freight transit time by eight days. This transformative railway, with its potential to enhance trade and economic cooperation between the countries along its path, holds the promise of a brighter future and instills optimism due to the potential economic benefits it will bring. According to an earlier announcement, the planned 523-km railway will be constructed through a joint venture involving three countries. The estimated total cost of the project is $8 billion, with $4.7 billion allocated for the Kyrgyz part. In a testament to the project's significance, Japarov emphasized that this project is crucial for Kyrgyzstan's global connectivity, allowing his landlocked country to connect with the rest of the world. The project was first proposed in the 1990s, and the three sides signed a memorandum of understanding on constructing the railway in 1997. Some experts believe political and geopolitical problems have hindered the project's development. However, we don't share this view. China is a pragmatic partner, and economic feasibility is crucial for making any decision. This time, practical considerations again played a critical role. The launch of this project occurred thanks to the unfolding Eurasian railway revolution, a clear demonstration of which are the facts listed below. On May 25, a significant event occurred: the 90,000th trip was made on the China-Europe freight rail link, mainly through its northern route via Kazakhstan and Russia. Since its inception in 2011, the service has transported over 8.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units containers carrying goods valued at more than $380 billion. This impressive accomplishment highlights the success of that railway link. Currently, China-Europe freight trains connect 223 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries, creating a service network spanning almost the entire Eurasian continent. Between 2016 and 2023, the annual number of China-Europe freight train trips increased from 1,702 to over 17,000. The value of goods transported by this service rose from $8 billion in 2016 to $56.7 billion in 2023.This rapid growth reflects the growing market demand for this efficient and dependable mode of transportation, especially when compared to air and sea routes. The traffic's rapid growth continued this year. From January to April, 6,184 China-Europe freight trains operated, delivering 675,000 TEUs of cargo. It represents a 10 percent increase in the number of trains and an 11 percent increase in cargo compared to the same period of last year. The set-scheduled service has further improved transit time, with a journey from Xi'an to Duisburg, Germany, now taking only 12 days. The rapidly growing rail traffic volume shows that developing an additional rail transport route between China and Europe, this time through Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South Caucasus, will be economically feasible. The construction of this railway line will create the shortest land route between the two economic centers of the Eurasian continent along the Middle Corridor. At the same time, it will establish direct rail connections between China and Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Iran, Turkiye, and Europe, transforming Central Asia from a landlocked to a land-connected area. The new railway lines will intersect in Central Asia with planned and under-construction railway lines in the North-South direction from Russia and Central Asia through Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the deep-water ports of the Indian Ocean. President of Uzbekistan Mirziyoyev specifically highlighted this potential during the signing ceremony on June 6 by saying that the railway will become the shortest land channel between China and the Central Asian countries and open the big markets of the South Asian and Middle Eastern countries. If this plan comes to fruition, the intersection of the East-West and North-South railway routes in Central Asia could transform the region into a major transport hub for the entire Eurasian continent. If this happens, the Great Silk Road revival could become a reality.

Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, announced 150 million rupees ($538,000) for Nadeem at a special ceremony to honor the star athlete in Islamabad. Sharif's announcement came hours after Punjab's chief minister Maryam Nawaz visited Nadeem's house, and presented him with a check for 100 million rupees. Nawaz also handed him the keys to a new car, which has a special registration number of \\\"PAK 92.97\\\" to commemorate Nadeem\\\\'s throw of 92.97 meters in Paris, which was an Olympic record. Nadeem\\\\'s coach Salman Iqbal Butt was also given 5 million rupees. \\\"You have doubled the delight of 250 million Pakistanis because we\\\\'ll also celebrate our Independence Day tomorrow,\\\" Sharif said while announcing the money for Nadeem, whose father is a daily wage laborer. \\\"Today every Pakistani is happy and the morale of the whole country is sky high.\\\" \\\"The feeling is very good,\\\" Nadeem said Tuesday. \\\"I hope to stay fit and break the world record one day.\\\" Last Thursday, Nadeem set off celebrations across Pakistan when his throw easily surpassed the previous Olympic mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.

Nadeem's Olympic gold is Pakistan's first since the men's field hockey team won 40 years ago at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Pakistan's last medal of any color was a field hockey bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Later Tuesday, Nadeem and his family were flown to Islamabad on a special flight from Multan to attend a reception hosted by Sharif, who paid tribute to the athlete during a cabinet meeting. \\\"Nadeem has elevated the name of Pakistan worldwide because of his days and nights of hard work, parents\\\\' prayers and coach\\\\'s training,\\\" Sharif said. Pakistan is predominantly known for cricket in the sporting world, with the country winning the 1992 World Cup. \\\"Seeing him on the podium waving the flag and ringing the Olympic bell was incredible,\\\" Pakistan cricket captain Shan Masood said on Tuesday, as he prepares for a Test series against Bangladesh, starting Aug 21 in Rawalpindi. Pakistan head coach Jason Gillespie said Nadeem will be invited to the dressing room of the Pakistan cricket team during the first Test match. \\\"Having him visit and share his gold medal with the team would be a fantastic boost, especially with the Olympic spirit still in the air,\\\" Gillespie said. \\\"It was a wonderful moment.\\\" A special postage stamp has also been issued in Nadeem's honor depicting his record throw.

On Nov 16, the first group of nine international student correspondents from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQPT) began their roles at a traditional Chinese event held at Chongqing Cotton Mill Yard in Shapingba district. The student correspondents come from the United States, Russia, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. They will write about their time in China and convey their perspectives through various media platforms. The program is a collaboration between CQPT, the Publicity Department of Shapingba district, and the China Daily Chongqing Bureau. The event featured a cultural experience centered around the \\\"Start of Winter\\\", the first solar term of the winter season. The students participated in traditional tea ceremonies, learned how to brew tea over a stove, and tried their hand at flower arranging. Chongqing, a megacity in southwest China with a population of over 32 million, serves as a gateway to inland China and is a major manufacturing hub. It became China's fourth municipality in 1997, after Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Spanning an area as large as Austria and five times the size of Beijing, Chongqing has experienced rapid development, transforming into a modern, cosmopolitan city with advanced transportation systems and impressive architecture. While its futuristic skyline of skyscrapers reflects the city's progress, Chongqing, with its 3,000-year history, also preserves a distinct culture and lifestyle. Global perspectives This combination of modernity and tradition makes Chongqing the ideal place for international students to tell their stories about China. Ly Hoang Anh, a graduate student from Vietnam, is excited to become a correspondent documenting her studies and life in the city. \\\"Actually, my childhood dream has always been to become a journalist. This is an interesting job that allows me to explore not only the landscapes of China but also its local life. I hope to have a meaningful experience, find happiness, and gain a deeper understanding of China,\\\" she said. Rucker Andrej Tavon from the US is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and enjoys exploring the city. \\\"I feel a deep passion about my life here in China, and I'd love to share it with others around the world, especially in my home country,\\\" he said. Garayev Atajan from Turkmenistan said his five years in China have been \\\"a journey of growth, filled with valuable experiences\\\" that have shaped both his academic and personal life. \\\"[Being a correspondent] allows me to share my perspective as an international student and promote cultural exchange between nations,\\\" he said. \\\"I aim to showcase the richness of Chinese culture  its traditions, festivals, and values  and how they connect with people from other cultures.\\\" tanyingzi@chinadaily.com.cn\",\n          \"A trilateral intergovernmental agreement on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project was signed at a ceremony in Beijing on June 6. President Xi Jinping, President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev hailed the event as a sign of unity and shared progress. In his address, President Xi underscored the railway project as an epitome of strategic cooperation within the Belt and Road Initiative. The signing of the agreement establishes a robust legal foundation for the project and signifies a major shift from a mere vision to a tangible reality. China's dedication to collaborating with the two Central Asian countries to accelerate the construction of this strategic transport corridor is a clear indication of the collective progress of the project, which is set to bring substantial benefits to all three countries. The governments of China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan agreed to embark on constructing the new railway at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit held in the Uzbek city of Samarkand in September, 2022. The project feasibility study was updated following the completion of field surveys by Chinese engineers in December last year. All three countries have diligently prepared for the construction, which is expected to commence later this year. The new railway, a beacon of hope and optimism, will start in China's Kashgar and traverse Torugart, Kosh-Dobo, and Kazarman in Kyrgyzstan, culminating in Andijan in eastern Uzbekistan. It is estimated that the railway will shorten the route between China and Europe by about 900 kilometers and reduce freight transit time by eight days. This transformative railway, with its potential to enhance trade and economic cooperation between the countries along its path, holds the promise of a brighter future and instills optimism due to the potential economic benefits it will bring. According to an earlier announcement, the planned 523-km railway will be constructed through a joint venture involving three countries. The estimated total cost of the project is $8 billion, with $4.7 billion allocated for the Kyrgyz part. In a testament to the project's significance, Japarov emphasized that this project is crucial for Kyrgyzstan's global connectivity, allowing his landlocked country to connect with the rest of the world. The project was first proposed in the 1990s, and the three sides signed a memorandum of understanding on constructing the railway in 1997. Some experts believe political and geopolitical problems have hindered the project's development. However, we don't share this view. China is a pragmatic partner, and economic feasibility is crucial for making any decision. This time, practical considerations again played a critical role. The launch of this project occurred thanks to the unfolding Eurasian railway revolution, a clear demonstration of which are the facts listed below. On May 25, a significant event occurred: the 90,000th trip was made on the China-Europe freight rail link, mainly through its northern route via Kazakhstan and Russia. Since its inception in 2011, the service has transported over 8.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units containers carrying goods valued at more than $380 billion. This impressive accomplishment highlights the success of that railway link. Currently, China-Europe freight trains connect 223 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries, creating a service network spanning almost the entire Eurasian continent. Between 2016 and 2023, the annual number of China-Europe freight train trips increased from 1,702 to over 17,000. The value of goods transported by this service rose from $8 billion in 2016 to $56.7 billion in 2023.This rapid growth reflects the growing market demand for this efficient and dependable mode of transportation, especially when compared to air and sea routes. The traffic's rapid growth continued this year. From January to April, 6,184 China-Europe freight trains operated, delivering 675,000 TEUs of cargo. It represents a 10 percent increase in the number of trains and an 11 percent increase in cargo compared to the same period of last year. The set-scheduled service has further improved transit time, with a journey from Xi'an to Duisburg, Germany, now taking only 12 days. The rapidly growing rail traffic volume shows that developing an additional rail transport route between China and Europe, this time through Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South Caucasus, will be economically feasible. The construction of this railway line will create the shortest land route between the two economic centers of the Eurasian continent along the Middle Corridor. At the same time, it will establish direct rail connections between China and Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Iran, Turkiye, and Europe, transforming Central Asia from a landlocked to a land-connected area. The new railway lines will intersect in Central Asia with planned and under-construction railway lines in the North-South direction from Russia and Central Asia through Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the deep-water ports of the Indian Ocean. President of Uzbekistan Mirziyoyev specifically highlighted this potential during the signing ceremony on June 6 by saying that the railway will become the shortest land channel between China and the Central Asian countries and open the big markets of the South Asian and Middle Eastern countries. If this plan comes to fruition, the intersection of the East-West and North-South railway routes in Central Asia could transform the region into a major transport hub for the entire Eurasian continent. If this happens, the Great Silk Road revival could become a reality.

Sharif's announcement came hours after Punjab's chief minister Maryam Nawaz visited Nadeem's house, and presented him with a check for 100 million rupees. Nawaz also handed him the keys to a new car, which has a special registration number of \\\"PAK 92.97\\\" to commemorate Nadeem's throw of 92.97 meters in Paris, which was an Olympic record.
