The same can be said about the visits of US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo last year and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in early April, and the resumption of the high-level military-to-military video meeting between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun  earlier this month. Surely, talking is better than fighting, but too many aggressive and provocative US moves and veiled (and not so veiled) threats negate the nice words the administration\'s representatives have said recently. Much work remains to be done to shore up damaged bilateral relations and avoid continuing lose-lose economic and political ""decoupling"". Here the picture is less rosy as exemplified by the ongoing US persecution of Huawei, China\'s top telecommunications company. I attended Huawei\'s Analyst Summit in Shenzhen of Guangdong province last week. The US, unwilling or unable to cooperate with China in the high-tech sector, continues its policy of restricting China\'s access to advanced computer chips. The US\' stated position is ""a small yard and high fence"", highly targeted restrictions against China for the most advanced dual-use computer chips on the pretext of safeguarding national security, but in reality it is intended to prevent China\'s continued economic rise, because Washington fears Beijing could challenge its global domination. Harvard professor Graham Allison says that in the past 500 years, a rising power spooking the established power has resulted in a conflict in 12 out of 16 cases. That\'s a frightening thought. From what I learned at the Huawei Analyst Summit, the sanctions of the US and its allies against Huawei, although dealing a blow to the company, have not only made it stronger but also expanded its horizons, from making better telecom equipment to ambitiously moving into artificial intelligence, cloud computing and a host of new-horizon, all-inclusive ""fifth industrial revolution"" services for consumers and businesses alike. It is a case of necessity being the mother of invention, first to stave off what could have been a fatal blow due to US pressure and then to move from being debilitated to prosperity by building an ecosystem unimaginable when Huawei was a small manufacturer of telephone switchboards at its birth in 1987. It's no less a remarkable story than that of Shenzhen, which from being a small fishing village a little more than four decades ago has developed into a metropolis of 17 million people with GDP of $500 billion, similar to that of Sweden or Thailand. Blinken, a guitarist who loves the work of blues genius Muddy Waters, must also know Cole Porter's famous Western/cowboy song Don't Fence Me In. Instead of fencing China in, he should be razing fences and engaging with China and other countries to build a community with a shared future for mankind where national interests overlap, that is if, and it's a very big if, we are going to have a future at all. Talking about the future brings us to Dubai. On April 16, the United Arab Emirates\' city received more rain in one day than it normally gets in one full year. On the other hand, last year was the hottest in 100,000 years, according to meteorologists, which prompted UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to say ""the era of global warming has ended"" and ""the era of global boiling has arrived"". Yet globally, we are stumbling on a straight path to extinction unable to give up fossil fuels, especially because of the energy giants in the US and other countries and their army of lobbyists promoting short-term profits at the cost of human existence. As for the US, although it has professed to have gone green for half a century, it has done little to prevent this catastrophe. As a matter of fact, it is resisting more fuel-efficient and clean-energy vehicles in favor of continuing producing huge gas-guzzlers. It doesn\'t want to accept that the world has changed. The US, however, could have been the global leader in clean energy but, due to political pressure from the farm lobby, opted to promote biofuels which are costly, raise global food prices and have negative environmental impacts like water pollution. At a time when the US was indulging in such activities, China was still a relatively poor country but realized that it had to plan for a sustainable future. Today, China is the global leader in renewable energy, especially in solar and wind energy. But instead of applauding China for its green achievements, the US is trying to check its peaceful rise, just as it tried to strangle Huawei. The smart, green and logical choice is to join forces with China when the alternative is extinction. But no, the US\' response is the opposite. To me, it\'s a no-brainer that the US and its allies should join forces with China and the Global South, because their national interests and very future depend on it. Sadly, I don\'t think they will, but they really should realize that ""decoupling"" cannot make the US stronger.

1,'Freak' Haaland scores outrageous goal as City demolishes Prague,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\25\WS671aee1aa310f1265a1c9863.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/25/WS671aee1aa310f1265a1c9863.html," MANCHESTER, England  Erling Haaland scored an outrageous backheel volley in the Champions League on Wednesday to issue a timely reminder of his own credentials as a potential Ballon d'Or winner. A day after Vinicius Junior hit a hat-trick for Real Madrid, Haaland scored an early contender for goal of the season with his acrobatic effort in Manchester City's 5-0 win against Sparta Prague. Vinicius is the favorite to win soccer's most prestigious individual prize when it is presented at a gala ceremony in Paris on Monday. But Haaland, who came runner-up to Lionel Messi for last year's award, once again showcased his scoring prowess with two goals, as City set a new Champions League record of 26 games unbeaten. Haaland's volley in the 58th minute at the Etihad Stadium was a moment of individual brilliance. From around six meters, and with his back to goal, the Norway striker leapt into the air and flicked the back of his foot to meet Savinho's cross from the right. Connecting powerfully with his heel, the ball shot down into the turf and bounced high into the top corner beyond Prague goalkeeper Peter Vindahl Jensen. ""If I tried to do that, I\'d pull my groin. I don\'t know how he did it, I just think it\'s just his long legs. He\'s a freak isn\'t he?"" Haaland\'s City teammate Phil Foden said. ""It shows he has the talent (and can do things) that no one else can do."" City manager Pep Guardiola said the goal was not normal ""for a human"", and likened the forward to Sweden great Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""It\'s unbelievable the talent that this guy has,"" he said. Haaland scored his second in the 68th, taking his season's total to 13 goals in 12 games in all competitions. His record in the Champions League is now 44 goals in 42 games. Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer in European club soccer's elite competition with 141 goals. Messi is second on 129. Haaland is 17th and rising quickly. But, he is expected to miss out on this year's Ballon d'Or with Vinicius seen as the man to beat, ahead of Haaland's City teammate Rodri. Haaland, however, is likely to contend for years to come if he continues his goal scoring exploits, with Vinicius and Kylian Mbappe leading a new generation, after Messi and Ronaldo dominated the award for more than a decade. Neither of those soccer greats, who won 13 titles between them, were nominated this year, appearing to usher in a new era.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/25/671aee1aa310f1268d837a37.jpeg'],"['Erling Haaland celebrates scoring Manchester City\'s fourth goal in Wednesday\'s Champions League match against Sparta Prague.

2,'Green and just transition',"('Nordic',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\20\WS673d25f9a310f1265a1ce7c7.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/20/WS673d25f9a310f1265a1ce7c7.html,"Following the 2024 European Parliament elections, a competitiveness strategy has been incorporated into the European Union's strategic agenda. The Future of European Competitiveness, a report introduced in September, addresses a range of areas, including scientific and technological competitiveness, green competitiveness, fair competitiveness, social competitiveness, industrial competitiveness and so forth. The report offers a detailed examination of the factors influencing Europe's future competitiveness, accompanied by strategic recommendations for addressing these challenges. It provides a comprehensive assessment of the obstacles confronting Europe in the context of the evolving global landscape and proposes a series of programs aimed at achieving sustainable growth, enhancing productivity and safeguarding European values. The EU is currently facing a significant challenge to maintaining its industrial competitiveness, prompting a search for solutions. First, the Centre for European Policy Studies has indicated that the EU economy has been affected by the Ukraine crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the escalation of US export controls and tariffs on China has resulted in an acceleration of Chinese products entering the EU market. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research posits that as oil and gas prices rise, the EU is becoming increasingly reliant on external clean energy products in its green transition. The EU's dependence on China for photovoltaic and wind power equipment and new energy vehicles is estimated to exceed 20 percent. Second, the energy crisis and the Ukraine crisis, along with other significant occurrences, have given rise to a novel political climate. This has prompted the EU to accord greater consideration to the significance of its single market, strategic autonomy and competitiveness concerns, while also expressing concern about China\'s ""economic intervention and control ""of the EU. Third, the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis has resulted in a decline in the EU\'s competitiveness across all aspects of the triangles of great powers, including the China-US-Russia, China-US-Europe and China-Europe-Russia triangles. This has led to a weakening of the EU\'s strategic autonomy and its influence in international affairs. The EU is striving to spearhead the ""green and just transition"", a process of competitiveness-building that will enable it to maintain its voice in the great power triangles and avoid becoming a victim of geopolitical competition between China and the United States. The EU\'s competitiveness strategy of a green and fair transition will be based on the construction of its internal supply chains, green trade barriers, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and other tools. The objective is to curb industrial outflow and reduce import dependence, as well as to enhance the level of the EU\'s local manufacturing industry. The improvement of the European single market represents a pivotal aspect of this strategy. One key objective is the formation of a new green supply chain spanning the Nordic countries, Central and Eastern Europe, and Germany and France, with a focus on critical raw materials for the energy transition. This initiative aims to reduce external dependence through the construction of the EU internal market. The EU\'s ""fair competition"" policy considers not only strategic autonomy and climate change, but also the demands of the middle class within EU member states. First, the EU\'s fundamental premise is that the cornerstone of a green and fair competition strategy is strategic autonomy. The EU\'s Fair Competition Strategy represents a solution to the dual challenges of pursuing climate change ambitions and improving industrial competitiveness. It also offers a means of achieving a balance between economic security and industrial decarbonization. This strategy places an emphasis on consensus among EU members, promotes policy coherence, and builds on the previously agreed European Green Deal to adapt and innovate policy instruments in order to highlight the competitiveness of the EU\'s climate economy. Second, the EU considers it essential to safeguard the interests of the middle class in all member states in order to ensure green and fair competitiveness. While the US is becoming increasingly detached from globalization, the EU is also aware of the dangers of over-globalization, which is detrimental to the interests of the middle class. The Centre for European Policy Studies posits that globalization has harmed the interests of the middle class and that Europe must find a way to accommodate both emerging and existing developed economies. In this regard, the EU has emphasized the decentralization of the industrial chain to different countries within the union, as well as the use of subsidies to finance the development of the industry. Third, the EU\'s foreign policy is still based on the principles of multilateralism, which it will continue to uphold in order to ensure fair competitiveness. The internal market and the system of bilateral and small multilateral trading partners will be accorded greater priority than global trading systems such as the World Trade Organization. The EU is increasingly examining its relations with China through the lens of ""fair competitiveness"", which is based on the concept of a green transition. First, the EU perceives China as engaging in unfair competition within the green industries, emphasizing that China is heavily subsidized in its pursuit of competitive advantage. For example, the Bruegel Institute in Brussels posits that China\'s subsidies and production capacity are excessive, that green industries are directly supported by the government, and that China\'s system has a natural advantage over other countries in manufacturing, which undermines the fairness of the global marketplace. The EU perceives China as a strategic competitor, with a government that exerts significant influence over the country\'s economic and industrial policies. Concurrently, given the pivotal role of the automotive industry in the European economy, the EU will implement policies to safeguard this sector in the near to intermediate term. For instance, the EU has the capacity to establish standards and implement tariffs with the objective of safeguarding its automotive industry. Furthermore, it has the option of postponing the decarbonization of its transportation sector in order to mitigate the impact of China\'s electric vehicles and advance its own clean energy industry. At present, the EU has put forth a strategy, designated as the ""China+1"" approach, with the objective of establishing a contingency plan for its manufacturing sector. Second, the EU continues to adhere to a tripartite positioning of China as a ""partner"", ""competitor"" and ""rival"" in a relatively short period of time. The EU views China as a partner for cooperation, an economic competitor and a systemic rival. Consequently, the EU differentiates its policies toward China based on the specific issue area in question. In the context of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the evolving relationship between Russia and China, the EU perceives China as a potential rival and a disruptive force in Sino-European relations. In the domains of energy and climate change, the EU perceives China as a cooperative partner.

In the language of the Ewenki ethnic group, Olguya means a place of lush poplar forest. The Ewenki people living there still preserve the traditional of hiking in the Greater Hinggan Mountains and keeping reindeer. The ice hotel makes use of roughly 1,500 metric tons of ice and snow, and now covers about 1,000 square meters. Those wishing for a chance to sleep within the icy dwelling have until the end of February to make their booking, before the whole building melts away as the warmer weather arrives in March and May. The operators say that the ice hotel will be rebuilt in the following winter. Currently, the hotel has 10 artistically hand-carved suites ranging from 10 to 15 square meters. It also has a recreation center, reading room, bar and dining hall. The temperature in the suites is a frosty - 5 C. Almost all internal facilities, including beds, tables and decorations are carved with ice.

6,A look at Asia's people-to-people exchanges from Tokyo 2020,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202109\07\WS6137618ba310efa1bd66df42.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202109/07/WS6137618ba310efa1bd66df42.html,"Editor's note: After the Tokyo Olympics wrapped up last month, the Paralympic Games concluded on Sept 5. In this article, Zhou Muzhi, professor at Tokyo Keizai University and head of Cloud River Urban Research Institute gives a rare glimpse of the Games from the unique perspectives of geographical features and people-to-people exchanges. In most previous Olympics, I found myself hard to sit down and enjoy the Games due to my busy schedules. This year, with the continued spread of COVID-19 and Tokyo under strict ""state of emergency,"" I had a rare chance of watching the Games amid the lockdowns. Here are some of my interesting takeaways from this year\'s event. 1. Hercules in the south First, to my great surprise, Shen Lijun, from my ancestral home Yiyang, China\'s southern Hunan province, has been crowned the Olympic champion in the weightlifting men\'s 67kg event, bucking my stereotype that Chinese Hercules were normally born in the northeastern or northwestern part of the country. After searching the information of 18 Chinese male Olympic weightlifting champions, I found out that only two were born in China\'s north, with the rest all come from the south. So it is no wonder that Xiang Yu, ""Hegemon-King of Western Chu"" during the ChuHan Contention period (206202 BC) of China, was also a native southerner and was said to have the strength that can lift mountains. I feel quite proud that I also come from the south like so many Chinese Hercules. 2. Ping Pong: North dominating the sport Another thing that surprises me is that many top Japanese Ping Pong players can speak very good Mandarin with northern accent. That's because they were trained by Chinese coaches since they were young. Since the Seoul Games in 1988 when Ping Pong officially became an Olympic sport, China has won 32 out of the 37 gold medals, accounting for 86% of the total, representing an overwhelming dominance in the game. Geographically, the 28 gold medal winners were mostly born in the north, including 10 from the northeastern part of the country. Retired Chinese Ping Pong players have been spotted worldwide as coaches of the foreign teams and promoters of the sport. Those Chinese coaches, either train their players in Japan or bring them back to China for intensified training, would naturally leave a northern mandarin accent on their disciples. For example, Ai Fukuhara, a four-time Japanese Olympian in women's table tennis, had a personal coach from northeastern China and a sparring partner from the same region to practice with her. She even joined a table tennis club in northeastern Liaoning province and picked up a heavy local accent. China's north has been holding Ping Pong's supremacy domestically, and also influenced its immediate neighbors like South Korea and Japan to be world's leaders in the sport. Olympians in Northeast Asia have dominated the event for years, with China, South Korea and Japan snatching 32, 3 and 1 gold medals respectively, accounting for 97% of the total. The dominance was only broken once by a Sweden Olympian at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The reason why the three countries in Northeast Asia could almost bag all the Olympic gold medals in Ping Pong can be attributed to their close people-to-people exchanges. Though Japan was not traditionally strong in Ping Pong, the sport is quite popular because its domestic audiences expect much from the game as it represents a platform for exchange and competition with the Chinese players. According to a recent survey in Japan, Ping Pong, instead of Judo in which the Japanese team clinched a staggering 9 gold medals, was ranked as the most thrilling event during the Tokyo 2020. Due to various historical reasons, countries in Northeast Asia have long been locked in mistrust and opposition. However, due to a long history of exchanges, people in those countries are invariably bonded together despite historical conflicts. 3. Badminton: South holds supremacy In contrast to Ping Pong, the sport of badminton is displaying a total different picture where the dominance is long held by China's south. Badminton was an exhibition sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul before debuted as an official medal sport at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. In the past nearly three decades, China has bagged 20 out of the 39 gold medals in the Olympic badminton events, accounting for 51.2% of the total. During previous Games, a total of 22 Chinese players were crowned as badminton champions, with seven come from central China, six from eastern China, four from southern China, and one from southwestern China. In the rest of Asia, Indonesia took eight, South Korea six, and Japan and Chinese Taipei each took one during previous Games. Therefore, Asian countries and regions have bagged up to 92% of all the gold medals in this sport, which reflected another thread in people-to-people exchanges in Asia. Badminton's development in China cannot be possible without the contributions of several legendary Indonesian Chinese players. In 1954, four Indonesian Chinese including Wang Wenjiao returned to China and helped promote the sport in the country. In 1960, more Indonesian young players like Tang Xianhu, Hou Jiachang, Fang Kaixiang and Chen Yuniang followed suit. As professional players and later coaches, they contributed hugely to China's current standing as one of badminton's powerhouses. The southern part of China, due to its close proximity to Indonesia, has naturally become a fertile ground for the sport to take off in the country. Throughout history, China's development has also benefited from its exchanges and interactions with neighboring countries and regions. People-to-people exchanges contributed greatly to the relations between China's north and the rest of the Northeast Asia and between China's south and the rest of the Southeast Asia, which are also mirrored in the friendly interactions among the Olympians at Tokyo 2020. China's relations with its neighbors, sometimes being regarded as historical burdens, should be more rationally defined as a rich historical legacy, which during the times of great global changes, may help create a solid foundation for peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region.",[],[],2021-09-07 20:56,China.org.cn,"- **Main Topics:**

Li was born in Beijing in 1952.His love of books blossomed during childhood. His father, a professor of foreign literature at Tsinghua University, subscribed to Yiwen, a magazine devoted to the translation and introduction of foreign literature, and bought many novels from China and abroad. After his father finished a book, his two elder sisters would read it before passing it along to him. From the beginning of 1968 until April 1969, Li worked at the library of the Affiliated High School of Peking University, where he read Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes and sci-fi books like Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. When Li worked in the countryside in Northeast China's Jilin province from 1969 to 1974, he took about 30 good books from the library with him, including ones by French writers Victor Hugo and Honore de Balzac. Four years later, he passed the college entrance examination and enrolled at Wuhan University to study Chinese language and literature.

Ouyang Minggao, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that it is crucial to seize the opportunities presented by AI by promoting advanced driving-assist technology and advancing fully autonomous driving. He made the remarks at the China EV100 Forum in Beijing earlier this month. Ouyang, also a Tsinghua professor and vice-president of the China EV 100, said that the application of AI across the life cycle of NEV design, manufacturing, management and recycling is crucial to achieving better quality industry-wide, reduced costs and better efficiency. China has led automotive electrification worldwide as the global penetration rate of new energy passenger vehicles is around 18 percent, while China's has surpassed 35 percent. BYD founder and CEO Wang Chuanfu said at the forum that as Chinese carmakers are strengthening the research and development efforts in NEVs, the number of new vehicle launches is rapidly increasing. Wang noted that NEVs accounted for more than 48.2 percent of car sales during the week from March 3-10. He estimated that the percentage of NEVs will exceed 50 percent within the next three months, becoming dominant in the market. Wang said: ""Only by laying a solid foundation in electrification can we construct the skyscraper of automotive intelligence."" As the world's largest NEV producer, BYD has reduced prices on several models since March, with some priced lower than gasoline-powered vehicles in the same segment. An Conghui, chairman of Geely Auto Group, said intelligent connected NEVs represent a more advanced form of productivity, not just a replacement for traditional fuel vehicles. ""Electric vehicles may appear to have fewer components than traditional gasoline vehicles  they actually contain billions of lines of code and hold countless diverse demand scenarios waiting to be explored,"" he said. An said Geely aspires to ""become Volkswagen AG in the era of NEVs ""because of its capabilities in global synergy. Among Chinese carmakers, Geely ranks first in terms of globalization with a big number of brands, from its namesake Geely, Lynk & Co and Zeekr to Lotus, Polestar and Volvo. EV startup Xpeng is considered the leading driving-assist solution provider nationwide. Its advanced driving-assist system XNGP had an 83 percent monthly active user rate as of February. It also excels in controlling costs for intelligent driving and aims to achieve a 50 percent cost reduction by the end of 2024 through technological innovation, according to CEO He Xiaopeng. He said that the next decade will be about competition in intelligence. The turning point for advanced intelligent driving will arrive within the next 18 months. He added that intelligent driving currently requires human intervention around 10 times per 100 kilometers on average, but this should drop to at least once in the future. Xpeng's AI driving large model will be integrated into vehicles in the second quarter of this year, the first mass-produced implementation of its kind in the auto industry. He also announced at the forum that Xpeng will launch a new brand with vehicles priced at 100,000 yuan ($13,890) to 150,000 yuan, which will feature the company's high-level intelligent driving-assist system, aimed at the younger generation. Cars with similar prices might be developed into fully autonomous vehicles in the future, he said. Xpeng\'s success with XNGP was contested by Huawei. Yu Chengdong, head of Huawei\'s smart vehicle unit, said at the forum: ""Xpeng has shown excellence domestically in intelligent parking and driving, but we aim to innovate with our advanced intelligent driving system, and our cabin and driving experiences are acknowledged as top-notch."" Yu Chengdong added that due to supply chain issues and other factors, Huawei's intelligent driving system remains relatively costly, posing challenges for vehicles to be priced below 300,000 yuan. Huawei's smart car business, which lost 6 billion yuan in 2023, is expected to turn a profit this year, thanks to strong sales of high-end models codeveloped with partners like Seres. Horizon Robotics founder and CEO Yu Kai said that competitive next-generation autonomous driving systems should be evaluated on their pass rate in standard scenarios, efficiency of passage and humanlike behavior to ensure comfort and familiarity for people. The chipmaker seized a 35.5 percent share in the driving-assist segment in 2023, second only to Nvidia. There are more than 110 models that sport their chips, with the number continuing to increase. Its clients include BYD and Li Auto, Yu Kai said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202403/25/6600d2ffa31082fc2b6b0c28.jpeg'],['A visitor experiences a smart cockpit at the 2023 Smart China Expo in Chongqing in September.\xa0HE PENGLEI/CHINA NEWS SERVICES'],2024-03-25 09:27,CAO YINGYING,"- **Main Topics:**

11,Access to a civilization,"('Swedish',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202308\02\WS64c9c717a31035260b819dd1.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202308/02/WS64c9c717a31035260b819dd1.html,"""The red walls and green tiles set each other off beautifully. It\'s so Beijing,"" said a 33-year-old Beijing resident surnamed Lin. Lin, together with her 14-year-old cousin surnamed Wang, was enjoying a city walk along the Beijing Central Axis, where most of the major old-city buildings of Beijing, like the Forbidden City and the Bell and Drum towers, sit. This summer, hashtags related to the trend of ""city walking"" have been more popular on numerous Chinese social media platforms. Traveling by foot, city walkers seek out interactions with locals, taste authentic snacks and gain a deeper appreciation for the history and culture of the capital city. For Wang, it was an exciting experience as a tourist. ""The ancient buildings that I have visited are very grand, and I want to learn more about the historical stories and figures behind these legacies,"" she said. And now, she may find some clues in the popular reality show Glory Is Back! Beijing. Premiered on streaming media platforms at home and abroad, including iQIYI and YouTube, in July, the reality show features captivating historic tales happening along the Beijing Central Axis spanning over 700 years. In each of the hour-long episodes, a group of celebrities and renowned scholars make inspiring journeys on the 7.8-kilometer-long axis to explore its origins, cultural roots and glories, attracting audiences mainly from Generation Z, observed Tong Tong, who works for iQIYI Gimbal Studio. The show aims to bring the Beijing Central Axis closer to young audiences, said producer He Jibing. ""I have noticed that many young people love taking a city walk along the Central Axis, and we hope to vividly present the historical and cultural charm of the axis from the perspective of young people."" For instance, in the first episode, the young explorers and scholars boarded a train and ""traveled"" through time and space to unveil the origin of the Beijing Central Axis, dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Involving role-playing activities, the show entertainingly recreated the scenes of architect Liu Bingzhong designing the axis. Liu was deeply influenced by the traditional Chinese architectural philosophy of ""sitting at the center of the world"". ""Our ancestors clearly explained the idea of the Central Axis in the classic Rites of Zhou: Records of Construction (one of China\'s oldest technological books dating back over 2,200 years), including its functions, characteristics and landscapes,"" said Shan Jixiang, former director of the Palace Museum and one of the show\'s guests. Based on ancient wisdom, the Central Axis not only links the different parts of Beijing, including royal palaces and marketplaces for common people, but also encapsulates key aspects of Chinese culture, such as the harmonious relationship between humankind and nature as well as the virtue of adhering to law and order. Once you understand the principle of ""respecting the middle"" embedded in the concept of the Central Axis, as Shan says in the show, you touch on the very root of Chinese people. However, the Beijing Central Axis is not set in stone. After hundreds of years of vicissitudes, it is still changing and has formed a special connection with generations of Chinese people. ""Especially when you take a stroll around the Bell and Drum towers, there\'s a palpable sense of energy in the hustle and bustle of daily life,"" said Lyu Zhou, a professor from Tsinghua University. At a square between the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, you can see local residents relaxing, cycling and playing games and even commemorating life events. ""We met each other and fell in love in Beijing,"" said a young couple who were taking wedding photos under the Bell and Drum towers. ""This was one of our favorite meeting spots when we went on dates. You could say that the towers have witnessed the blossoming of our love."" In Lyu's eyes, everyone has their own understanding of the Beijing Central Axis, and Chinese civilization is inherited and carried forward in this way. As a guest of the show, Lyu was impressed by how the Central Axis was understood and empowered, especially by today's young people. Su Yijun, a Gen Z virtual architect, shared in the show his own way of taking in the sights of the Central Axis  building a digital model in the popular video game Minecraft. Take his game version of the Forbidden City as an example, it covers a square grid of about 100 million blocks. Every facade of every building is a reflection of its real-life counterpart, and every last detail in the home of 24 emperors that ruled over a span of about 500 years is included. Su is not alone. It is worth mentioning that this digital model was built by a team of 120 young people led by Su. All of them worked on it voluntarily, and this shared interest in Chinese historical architecture has even transcended geographic borders and cultures. ""All of my friends like the Forbidden City, and this is my first visit to the Zhengyang Gate. It\'s very helpful that there are bilingual signs that I can read to learn about the history,"" said a Moroccan visitor who was hanging out with her friend from Botswana at the Zhengyang Gate in central Beijing. Throughout history, a number of foreign visitors from other parts of the world have left their footprints on the Beijing Central Axis. The Venetian merchant and adventurer Marco Polo (1254-1324), for example, wrote about what he saw along the Central Axis in The Travels of Marco Polo back in the Yuan Dynasty: ""Up and down the city there are beautiful palaces, and many great and fine hostelries, and fine houses in great numbers."" And Swedish scholar Osvald Siren (1879-1966) took precious photos of walls and gates in Beijing back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These Western records have offered people around the world a glimpse of this remarkable slice of history. Shan, Lyu and He all agree that it is Chinese young people that are playing an increasingly active role in sharing cultural knowledge of the Beijing Central Axis with the world in their own unique ways, such as by city walking, filming vlogs and even using cutting-edge technologies like game design. ""As a generation with growing cultural confidence, Chinese young people of today can look to the rest of the world as their equals,"" noted He. ""Now they are tending to look inward, trying to figure out what makes China China and sharing the answer with the rest of the world.""",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202308/02/64c9c717a310352610ba0442.png'],['[Photo by Liang Guoxiu/China Daily]'],2023-08-02 11:33,Wang Xingwei,"- **Main Topics:**

The former Formula 1 champion failed to qualify for the race last year in a spectacularly woeful effort by McLaren. The Spaniard has returned to Indianapolis Motor Speedway for a third attempt at winning the final leg of motor sports' Triple Crown, this time with an experienced organization. Alonso will drive in the Aug 23 race for Arrow McLaren SP, the Sam Schmidt-owned team that has been bolstered this year by a partnership with McLaren. During his recent seat fitting, Alonso noted the team is on top of preparations. ""I found a lot of talented people and good resources on everything, a lot of personnel, each one doing a specific job,"" Alonso told Associated Press on Tuesday. ""I had a very nice feeling, a nice surprise of how well the team is organized and prepared and I think it\'s going to be a good 500 for us."" Alonso entered his first Indy 500 in 2017 with Andretti Autosport and led 27 laps before an engine failure ended his day late in the race. He returned last season as McLaren attempted to build a team that could qualify for Indianapolis on its own. The project was a disaster from the start. The team tried to make its own steering wheel and wound up scrambling to buy one instead for Alonso's first test in the car. He lost track time at both the test and at Indianapolis when his cars weren't the proper shade of McLaren orange. The miscues continued all the way through qualifying when Alonso was bumped from the field of 33 by cars with considerably smaller budgets. ""I think last year was different, we were maybe too new for this job and the people maybe did not have the experience in IndyCar that was required for the event,"" Alonso said. ""With the guys here at Arrow, they\'ve been racing for many years and they know everything about the series, they know everything about the car. ""Everything seems different this year, there is more in our hands and there are no surprises here or there. Everything is very organized and we are ready to go on track."" Alonso won the Monaco Grand Prix in 2006 and 2007 for the first leg of the Triple Crown. He added back-to-back wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2018 and 2019 for the second leg, leaving the American classic as the only missing race. Graham Hill is the only driver to win the Triple Crown, closing it with a win at Le Mans in 1972. Alonso is one of only 19 drivers to have competed in all three legs, and he and Juan Pablo Montoya are the only active drivers with wins in two of the three events. McLaren boss Zak Brown told AP this year's effort for Alonso is far superior than last year's attempt. ""I feel night and day different. We\'ve got an established operation and we\'ve seen the progress Arrow McLaren SP is making,"" Brown said. ""We\'ve got good people around him and people from McLaren who have worked with him, so we\'re fully focused on putting a good car underneath him to give him the best shot we can."" Schmidt overhauled his lineup after McLaren became a partner, replacing James Hinchcliffe and Marcus Ericsson with Patricio O'Ward and Oliver Askew. The two newcomers have a combined 20 IndyCar starts between them and neither has raced in an Indy 500. Alonso, who is 39 and headed back to a full-time ride in F1 next season, is far more experienced than his two new teammates. Askew is 23, O'Ward is 21. Alonso noted the practice time for this year's race is nearly 11 hours less than his two previous Indy trips. He also hasn't competed in anything since the Dakar Rally in January, and his last time in a single-seat car was at Indianapolis 15 months ago. ""No worries with Fernando. He\'s the most versatile driver I\'ve worked with and his commitment levels and professionalism are second to none,"" Brown said. ""He has a ton of experience at the top level and drivers of his caliber, and there ain\'t many, don\'t take long to get back up to speed."" Alonso did not have anything scheduled this year as he had planned to prepare for the Indy 500 and then his return to Renault in F1 next season. An April test session at Indianapolis and simulator time in North Carolina were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic and he spent the last six months training in Switzerland. He said his desire to win Indianapolis and complete the Triple Crown has never been stronger. ""It\'s one of those things that you need to keep trying because eventually maybe one time it will come your way,"" Alonso said. ""The 500, especially, or Le Mans, they are races that you have been chosen that dayby the race, by the track, by the luck or destiny. There are no exacting mathematics on those kind of races. There is a luck factor. I have this impression that the more times you attempt, the more chances you\'ve got.""

Sporting manager Amorim has accepted United's offer to replace Erik ten Hag, and will officially take charge of the troubled Premier League club on Nov 11. Regarded as one of Europe's brightest young managerial minds, the 39-year-old delivered a tantalizing glimpse of his acumen, as Sporting exposed injury-hit City's defensive weaknesses. Phil Foden put City ahead in the opening moments at the Jose Alvalade stadium, but the visiting side wasted a string of chances to increase its lead and Sporting made it pay. Viktor Gyokeres equalized before halftime and Maximiliano Araujo bagged Sporting's second after the break, before Gyokeres' penalty capped its incredible fightback. Gyokeres is the first Swede to score a Champions League hat-trick since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in 2013. Amorim, who led Sporting to two Portuguese titles in four years, will take charge of his first United game at Ipswich on Nov 24. But, he is far too astute to claim that one victory proves he can revitalize moribund United, which is in the grip of its worst start to a season since 1986-87. ""What I can tell you is that this doesn\'t mean anything in particular, don\'t take anything from this,"" Amorim said. ""It\'s misleading, we were very lucky today. We cannot transport one reality to another. Manchester United cannot play the way we play, and we will have to adapt."" Amorim was lauded by Sporting fans throughout his last home game, before his jubilant players gave him a memorable send-off by tossing him in the air in celebration after the final whistle. ""The feeling with my players and the moment with the fans were very special, so I take this to Premier League,"" he said. ""When I arrive there, it\'s a different world, a different pressure. I will try to be the same. It will be fun, very fun, and I\'m ready."" 'Start from a lower level' Despite handing Guardiola his heaviest defeat since 2020, Amorim paid his respects to the manager he must outwit over a whole season, rather than just one game, if the balance of power in Manchester is to shift back to Old Trafford. City has won six titles in eight years under Guardiola, while United hasn't been crowned champion since 2013. ""He is so much better than me at the moment. But, I believe a lot in my newest club,"" Amorim said. ""We will start from a lower level, maybe I can say that, and we will improve the team, the club. Let\'s see."" Sweden striker Gyokeres would be a useful addition to United's misfiring attack on the evidence of his ruthless demolition of injury-hit City. The former Coventry striker has emerged as a Champions League sensation this season, but Amorim said he doesn't expect to bring him to United. ""No, no. I cannot be funny with that in this moment. It was tough for me to leave. If I start to joke about that with Gyokeres then I have problems,"" he said. ""This is my city, this is my country, so I will respect that Viktor has to stay until the end of the season and then, maybe he is going somewhere else."" Amorim took a long lap of honor after his perfect farewell victory and Gyokeres is in no doubt about his departing manager's qualities ""Of course we will miss him a lot, we have done amazing things together,"" Gyokeres said of Amorim. ""We have to look forward to the next challenge ahead of us, but first of all, we have another game on Sunday.""

  - Yes, the article mentions that Gustav Svensson (presumably Viktor Gyokeres) is a Swedish player who has played for Sporting Lisbon.

- **Mentions of Sweden:**
  The article discusses Gustav Svensson's achievements as a player and coach in European football, but does not mention him being from Sweden. However, it implies that he was born and raised in Sweden before becoming a professional footballer by mentioning his ability to score a Champions League hat-trick since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in 2013.","Here is the nuanced analysis:

**Tone and Style:** The overall tone of the article is neutral, with a hint of skepticism towards Manchester United's chances under Erik ten Hag. The language used is formal and professional, with an emphasis on conveying the manager's expertise and managerial acumen.

**Implied Motives:**

* To convince readers that Sporting Lisbon will improve at Manchester United, highlighting the new manager's potential to revitalize the club.
* To praise Sporting Lisbon for making a positive impact in Lisbon despite struggling at Manchester United.
* To deflect criticism of Manchester United's performance by focusing on Sporting Lisbon's achievements.

**Subtle Implications:**

* The use of loaded terms like ""Moribund"" and ""Lucky today"" to describe Manchester United's recent start suggests that the article may have a biased or sensationalist tone.
* The phrase ""We will have to adapt"" implies that Sporting Lisbon is in some way responsible for Manchester United's performance, which could be seen as implying that the club's woes are due to their lack of progress with Amorim at the helm.
* The statement ""He is so much better than me at the moment. But, I believe a lot in my newest club"" suggests that Sporting Lisbon is prioritizing their interests over Manchester United's.

**Intended Audience Impact:**

* It is likely intended to instill trust and respect for Sporting Lisbon among readers who are following the story.
* The tone may also be aimed at persuading readers that the new manager will help improve Manchester United, which could lead to a sense of hope or optimism about their chances.

**Summary:** The article discusses Sporting Lisbon's Champions League victory over Manchester City, which does not necessarily imply that Amorim will have an immediate impact on Manchester United. While the article highlights Amorim's potential to revitalize United, it also subtly implies that the club's performance is due to factors outside of Amorim's control.

**1-2 sentence summary:** Sporting Lisbon's 4-1 win over Manchester City has raised hopes about their ability to improve at Manchester United under Erik ten Hag. However, the article also suggests that United may have a hand in their decline, implying that their struggles are due to factors outside of Amorim's control."

That month of this year, the 61-year-old man visited his hometown, Chicago. But wherever he is, Linden always holds China dear in his heart as his ""spiritual homeland"". His plans for September called for visiting Japan and delivering lectures with a focus on China, before returning to Xizhou town in the Dali Bai autonomous prefecture in southwestern China's Yunnan province to oversee the operation of the Linden Center  his namesake hotel brand and cultural exchange hub founded in 2008. The building that hosts this flagship Linden Center was previously the old mansion of local merchant Yang Pinxiang. Since 2008, Linden Centers have also been opened in other places like Dali's Shaxi town and Jiangsu province's Suzhou. ""The initial intention behind establishing the Linden Center was to construct a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the world,"" says Linden. That\'s why they\'re called ""Linden Centers"" rather than ""Linden Hotels"". ""What China has accomplished in 40 years is a miracle for humanity,"" says Linden. ""I want to tell a better story of China to the world."" Speaking of his arrival in the country in the 1980s, he quotes the 2,500-year-old Confucian maxim: ""It is such a delight to have friends come from afar."" Linden is from Chicago. Before coming to China, he was a part-time night school college student, who cleaned carpets for a living. One day, he went to clean the carpet of the home of an instructor who had just returned from China. The lecturer asked him to help place a marker on China on a world map. Linden replied: ""I\'m sorry. I don\'t know where China is."" He was captivated by the teacher's stories about China. Soon after, he saw a poster announcing scholarships to study overseas in China and applied. ""It changed my life,"" he says. During his stay, Linden had the opportunity to star in a movie that told the story of an American student who loved China. He later interned at CBS News and was fortunate to witness China's process of opening up to the world. While undertaking graduate studies at Nanjing University, he met Jeanee, a Chinese-American woman who became his wife. The couple embarked on train journeys across the country, not only exploring China's magnificent landscapes but also feeling the people's warmth and kindness. ""When the Chinese people see someone like me who makes an effort to speak their language and respect the Chinese people and traditions, they have always given me more respect than I deserve,"" Linden says. China has given so much to Linden that he, in turn, wanted to contribute to China's growth and promote the country to the outside world. Because of his China experience, a Swedish company hired him to engage in cross-cultural education work in 1990. This led him to realize how lacking Western understanding of the country was. This prompted the couple to return to the US and found an art gallery showcasing Asian artworks in Door County, Wisconsin. The couple moved back to China in 2004, this time, with their two sons. ""I wanted to expose them as well to China\'s cultural richness,"" he recalls. They spent two years traveling much of the country before deciding to open their first center in Xizhou. Linden\'s team renovated the courtyard into a hotel according to the principle of ""preserving the old as it was"", conserving the ethnic Bai architecture, layout, wooden carvings and murals. International visitors not only booked guestrooms at the center but also explored the surrounding Bai villages under the guidance of its staff. ""We have thousands of people coming every year,"" Linden says. ""I live in the hotel, so my passion for Xizhou and China is immediately shared with these people."" Linden hopes to go beyond enhancing global understanding of China in general to proactively boosting people-to-people exchanges with the US in particular. Last year, he published his memoir of his 40 years in China, One Village at a Time.

However, Australian Studies started relatively late in China compared with study of the United Kingdom and the United States. The popularity of Australian Studies is the result of several factors, Wang said. Australia is located in Asia and has close proximity to China, and it is in the antipodean country's economic interests to be on good terms with China. Another reason is overseas students are profitable for Australia's education sector, despite grumblings from some locals their impact has contributed to the rise in property prices and other commodities. The Australian Studies Center has established very good relations with their counterparts in Australia, he said. ""The ties are beautiful, and they can help increase understanding and reduce potential conflicts between the two sides,"" Wang said. His center has organized the translation of classic Australian novels into Chinese, and participated in events such as talks between the Chinese author Mo Yan, who was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in literature, and South African-Australian novelist and essayist J.M. Coetzee. Angela Lehmann, chair of the Foundation for Australian Studies in China, said Australian Studies programs have become a ""strong network"" for research and teaching in the Chinese university sector. These studies have expanded since the 1980s with support from the Australia-China Council and the foundation. ""Good academic relations exist between Australian and Chinese figures, and the research, publications and translations emerging in China have been increasingly significant over recent years,"" Dr Lehmann told China Daily. ""These centers have wide-ranging interests from Australian and comparative literature and cultural studies to economics and trade, political systems, environmental studies, gender, indigenous studies, social sciences and more. ""Some centers offer courses and programs, and others are more focused on research activities and public events."" There are an estimated 250 scholars in China currently involved in teaching and doing research on Australia, and many more students taking part in undergraduate or postgraduate courses linked to Australian Studies. ""The popularity has been driven by the experience of leading scholars who spent time in Australia, who came back to China and developed courses to teach and build a new generation of scholars with an interest in Australia,"" Lehmann said. ""Initially, the focus of many Australian Studies centers was on literature and translation, as English Studies departments often were linked to those with an interest in Australia. ""Now we are seeing the diversification of disciplines that these scholars are engaging with. The community has grown in terms of numbers, but also in breadth  more scholars (are) studying a wider range of topics."" Lehmann said Australian Studies enable students in China to learn and engage with Australia. ""Many of these students may not otherwise have the opportunity to learn about Australia. Many will go on to study in Australia or engage with Australia throughout their careers,"" she added.

The awesome Aussie would not be denied. Minjee Lee won the US Women's Open by four strokes over Mina Harigae at Pine Needles on Sunday to earn $1.8 million, the largest payout in the history of women's golf. Lee closed with an even-par 71 to finish at 13-under 271 after the Australian flirted with the tournament record of 16 under set by Juli Inkster in 1999 at Old Waverly. ""I mean, I\'m speechless,"" Lee said. ""I can\'t believe it right now. No, it\'s just super, super special and just a great honor. It\'s been my dream since I was a little girl. It\'s the one that I always wanted to win on; now I\'ve done it, and just feels amazing."" Lee's winnings came from a record $10 million purse. ""We\'re only moving in the right direction,"" Lee said. ""I think it\'s only going to get better and better from here. It\'s such a large sum, and I\'m really honored to be the first winner I guess of this sum. We\'re only going to get better and better."" Harigae shot a 72 for her best finish in a major and a check of slightly more than $1 million. Although she knew she had no chance to win down the stretch, Harigae said it was still stressful knowing that $1 million  a check that is larger than the winner makes at most LPGA Tour events  was at stake. ""I\'m not going to lie, my stomach hurt the last couple holes coming down the stretch,"" Harigae said. ""I was really stressed out, but I was really just focusing on one shot at a time, making solid contact, and just hitting good putts."" South Korea's Hye-Jin Choi was one of only two players to break par Sunday, carding a 70 to finish third at 7 under. South Korea's Jin Young Ko, the world's No. 1-ranked player, finished fourth at 6 under, seven shots back of the lead after a 71. Lydia Ko was at 5 under after a 72. Ingrid Lindblad, the LSU player from Sweden, was the low amateur at 1 under, tying for 11th after a 76. The 26-year-old Lee was never challenged on a course that played significantly tougher than the previous three days. She opened with rounds of 67, 66 and 67. Lee became the sixth straight international player to win the US Women's Open and the first from Australia since mentor Karrie Webb in 2001. It was her second win at a major championship overall after winning the Evian Championship last July. Her previous best finish at the US Open was a tie for 11th in 2017. Lee, who entered the week ranked No. 4 in the world, has won eight LPGA Tour events and became the first repeat winner this year following her victory at the Founders Cup three weeks ago in New Jersey. Lee entered the final round with a three-stroke lead over Harigae and said after the third round her goal was to continue to stay aggressive and make birdies. She lived up to that early on, birdieing the first two holes to move to 15 under and take a five-stroke lead over Harigae. She stumbled a bit with bogeys on Nos. 5 and 7, but was still able to make the turn at even-par 35 and with a four-stroke cushion when Harigae also bogeyed the seventh. The lead increased to five after Harigae bogeyed the par-4 11th hole, all but sealing the win. Lee then knocked in a bending nine-foot birdie putt on No. 12 to push the lead to six, prompting her to thrust her arm in celebration. She appeared to eye Inkster's record when she got to 15 under after a birdie on the par-5 15th hole, but closed with two bogeys. Harigae didn't make her first birdie until the 15th hole. Lee said she's never been more nervous on a golf course  even though she never led by fewer than three strokes. ""Even with a three-shot lead I never felt comfortable today,"" Lee said. ""I felt like I still needed to play well. I still needed to hold my ground. That\'s pretty much what I did. To start aggressively, I think it was the right move, and then after that I had quite a big lead, so I was able to just play my game just to finish."" Webb, Australia's greatest female golfer with seven majors, has known Lee since she was 14. She has a scholarship program to bring young Aussie amateurs to majors to spend a week with her and experience it all. Minjee won the scholarship twice. Webb won her second US Women's Open at Pine Needles in 2001 by eight shots. Webb was at Philadelphia Cricket Club at a pre-arranged outing, charged up her phone until it was time to tee off and spent the day checking scores, then watched on streaming the final three holes. ""So amazing. Just the way she played all week, she never looked like the moment was getting to her at all. I think she struggled a little bit at the start of last year with putting, and now it\'s the best part of the game for her. If she keeps putting like that, she\'s got the whole package."" Webb said she texted her during the week, not with any advice but simple phrases like ""I love your work."" Nelly Korda closed with a 73 on Sunday to tie for eighth at 2 under in her first tournament since undergoing surgery to repair a blood clot in her left arm. ""The first week back you have rust, right, so you don\'t really expect much from your game,"" said Korda, the world\'s No. 2 player. ""You don\'t know where your game is at. Knowing that I can play on a really tough golf course at a major and even kind of be in contention is definitely a positive.""

The intended effect is to inform the reader about the doping incidents without appearing to take a stance or promote any agenda. However, the inclusion of terms like ""total of 10 doping cases"" and ""in-competition anti-doping control"" may create a sense of alarm or concern in the reader.

**Summary:**
Two athletes, Justin Brownlee and Sami Bzai, tested positive for banned substances at the Asian Games men's basketball tournament. The International Testing Agency (ITA) has confirmed these results and informed both players that they have the right to request further analysis."

Nearly 70 institutions from 38 countries in five continents have joined. Member organizations represent a range of leading institutions in the field of dance and the broader arts, including the California Institute of the Arts and the New York University from the United States, the UK's Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance and Australia's University of Melbourne, all of which are among the world's top-ranking universities. ""Every region and every culture play a crucial role in preserving the world\'s cultural diversity and bear a corresponding responsibility. This alliance highlights not only the professional representation of global dance education, but also geographical and cultural diversity, reflecting the alliance\'s aim of building a global community of dance arts,"" says Xu Rui, president of the Beijing Dance Academy. The official launch of the alliance took place on the morning of Oct 18, with an online forum, coinciding with the 70th anniversary celebration of the Beijing Dance Academy. The design of the alliance\'s logo has been inspired by Matisse\'s painting Dance, which features dancers embracing and radiating outward in a concentric circle, forming the letter ""D"". The five colors represent dance educators from the five continents, holding hands and dancing in a circle. According to Xu, the alliance will be a platform for uniting global experts and scholars in dance education. Through this network, the alliance will foster collaborative talent development, joint artistic practices, academic research, and faculty exchange programs. ""China, with its long history and rich traditions, continues to contribute its unique philosophy, aesthetics and artistic expressions to the world. Chinese dance is a vivid manifestation of this cultural heritage,"" Xu said in his speech. ""Since reform and opening-up in 1978, the interaction between Chinese and Western dance cultures through modern Western dance has profoundly influenced the concepts and methods of Chinese dance. It is within this cultural background, of the fusion of modern and traditional, the East and the West, that Chinese dance has developed a unique, contemporary style.""

Anna Maria Galeotti, director of Italy's Accademia Nazionale di Danza, emphasizes the importance of collaboration among global dance education institutions. She says that contemporary dancers need not only physical readiness, but also artistic sensitivity. Dance institutions in various countries should prepare students both psychologically and technically.

Kundera has been influencing generations of Chinese readers since his writing was first introduced to the country in the late 1980s. One of his representative works, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, has sold more than 3 million copies since the Shanghai Translation Publishing House released its Chinese version in 2003, the publisher says.

In his keynote speech, Schrder said the forum was not only focused on the exchange of ideas but was also a symbolic venue that highlighted the world's growing interdependence. He argued that collaboration between the European Union and China, particularly in the fields of civilizations, information technology and new quality productivity, holds the potential to not only address but actively shape the global challenges of the 21st century. Citing the ancient Silk Road as a vivid symbol of long-standing China-Europe exchange, Schrder said the connections between Europe and China extend far back in time. The Silk Road was a channel through which knowledge and innovation flowedfrom the invention of paper and the compass to philosophies and art forms that significantly inspired European Renaissance humanism, he said. This early global network not only created wealth but also fostered a profound awareness that progress is always a cooperative effort, he added. The former German politician reiterated that cultural exchange forms the foundation of mutual understanding and contributes to global stability by fostering mutual understanding and reducing prejudice. He commended the significance of programs like Erasmus+ and Study in China, the Confucius Institutes in Europe and European cultural centers in China. Schrder also emphasized the importance of technological collaboration between China and Europe, which share a vision of a digitally interconnected world. He praised initiatives such as the Digital Silk Road, which link regions through advanced digital infrastructures, with European companies like Nokia and Ericsson playing a crucial role. One particularly noteworthy area of collaboration is artificial intelligence. While Europe leads with ethical standards and regulatory frameworks, China brings its vast data resources and pragmatic development approaches, he said. Schrder pointed out that sustainability is the key to new quality productivity and the EU and China have been working closely to create a sustainable circular economy by collaborating on areas including offshore wind energy, battery storage and low-emission vehicles. China, as the worlds largest producer of solar panels, and the EU, as a pioneer in green standards, are jointly paving the way toward climate neutrality, he said. Schrder proposed the establishment of an EU-China Cultural Fund to deepen the exchange between civilizations, a Global Green Partnership program aimed at setting global standards for sustainable production and consumption, and an annual EU-China Cooperation Index to document progress and achievements. Meng began his keynote speech by discussing the origin and meaning of Germanys Chinese name deguo . Based on the sound of Deutschland, the German name for Germany, deguo means the state of virtues. Meng stated that the admiration for virtues is the cornerstone of the Chinese spirit. ""Confucianism holds that one who exercises government using his virtue may be compared to the North polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it. This shows that virtues are regarded as the foundation of governance,"" said Meng, a descendant of Chinese Confucian philosopher Mencius. He said that Germanys world-renowned incredible tradition of craftsmanship, which makes German-made products a symbol of quality, speaks volumes about the German peoples pursuit of virtues. Meng further called on the promotion of the pursuit of virtues as the foundation of China-Germany ties, as the two countries accelerate cooperation in trade, technology, education, culture and tourism. The forum was hosted by the Mencius Foundation.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d1d64a310f1268d85e2cb.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202412/02/674d1d64a310f1268d85e2cf.jpeg']","['The China-Germany Civilization Dialogue Forum, featuring former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\\xc3\\xb6der (center) and Meng Liang (right), chairperson of the Mencius Foundation was held on Nov 27 in Boao, Hainan province, as part of the 5th Boao\xa0Belt and Road Global Financial Conference.

Klas Ostergren, a member of the Swedish Academy, said the 75-year-old US singer-songwriter received his award during a small gathering on Saturday afternoon at a hotel next to the conference center where Dylan was performing a concert later that night. Ostergren said that the ceremony was a small, intimate event in line with the singer's wishes, with just academy members and a member of Dylan's staff attending. ""It went very well indeed,"" he said, describing Dylan as ""a very nice, kind man"". Other members of the academy told Swedish media that Dylan seemed pleased by the award. During his show hours later, Dylan made no reference to the Nobel award, simply performing a set blending old classics with tunes from his more recent albums. Dylan had declined the invitation to attend the traditional Nobel Prize banquet and ceremony on Dec 10 the date of Alfred Nobel's death pleading other commitments. But in order to receive the award worth 8 million kronor ($891,000), Dylan must give a lecture within six months from Dec 10. He has said he will not give his Nobel lecture this weekend but a recorded version of it will be sent later. Taped Nobel lectures have been occasionally presented, most recently in 2013 by Canadian Nobel literature laureate Alice Munro. ""I think he has said it all already as you heard in the acceptance speech. And you know, Dylan didn\'t apply for the Nobel prize. People seem to forget that. It wasn\'t a competition, he didn\'t ask for it, he was bestowed it. It\'s not for the giver of a gift to expect something in return,"" said Shmuel Burger, a 61-year-old physician and die-hard Dylan fan who traveled from Israel for the concert. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Dylan ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"".

The Dutch hurdler, who set a world record when winning the 400m flat in the world indoors in Glasgow in March, was pushed early on by Jamaica's Rushell Clayton and Andrenette Knight, in a field featuring five athletes from the final at last year's world champs in Budapest. But she held her form to easily pull clear down the home stretch, although her time of 53.07 seconds was slightly off the world lead of 52.70sec set by American arch-rival Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone on Friday. Duplantis made sure the vociferous home crowd had lots to cheer for in the men's pole vault. The US-born Swede wrapped up the competition with a winning height of 6.00m, but then had three very close attempts at 6.25m, 1cm higher than his own world record set at the Xiamen Diamond League six weeks ago. Arguably, Algeria's Djamel Sedjati produced the performance of the meeting in the Swedish capital, the seventh on the 15-meet Diamond League circuit. Sedjati, the 2022 world silver medallist, scorched to victory in the 800m in 1min 43.23sec, the fastest time of the season so far. Improved Jackson wins There was an improved showing in the 200m by Jamaica's two-time world champion Shericka Jackson after a disappointing outing at the Oslo Diamond League meet on Thursday in which she finished fifth. Jackson clocked a season's best of 22.69m, but again looked slightly laboured. Britain's strength in depth in middle distance was again on show. Laura Muir claimed victory in the 1500m in 3:57.99 while teammate Jemma Reekie took the 800m in 1:57.79. Muir, however, will not be part of the British team heading to the June 7-12 European championships in Rome, preferring instead to focus on the July 26-August 11 Paris Olympics. ""I have to bear in mind we are only at the end of May, start of June and it is all about August this year. That is when I need to be at my best,"" Muir said. ""I want to put everything I have into the Olympics. The champs would take too much out of training and I want to put all I can into the next two months of training as it is all about August this year."" Reekie will compete in the 1500m in Rome, but expects a tough battle to make the podium. ""I know that those 1500m girls are going to make it tough for me so it would be amazing to run away with a medal,"" she said. Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh had a convincing victory in the women's high jump, winning with a best of 2.00m, two jumps clear of a strong field. In what was the Ukrainian\'s outdoor opener, Mahuchikh said: ""It is good for the start. I am looking forward to competing in Rome where I will defend my European title and I want to show a better result there. ""This was my first ever competition with my new run-up so I tried it but I need more practice and I am sure in Rome it will be better."" Alison Dos Santos made it three wins from three in the Diamond League with victory in the 400m hurdles in 47.02sec, fresh from having trumped Olympic champion and world record holder Karsten Warholm in Oslo. ""We have like whole group of athletes who are really doing well at the 400m hurdles,"" said Dos Santos, who now returns to training camp in Florida before returning to do one more Diamond League meet before the Paris Games. ""I never get tired. Never ever. I am always ready."" American Chase Jackson followed the Brazilian's footsteps, winning her third meet with a best of 20.00m in the women's shot put.

Over the decades, China and Finland have forged strong bonds in various sectors, with a focus on economic collaboration, trade relations and investment ventures that have laid a solid foundation for continued growth. In his recent article titled Join Hands Together on the Right Path, Usher in a Brighter Prospect for Humanity  In Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China published by Daily Finland, Chinese Ambassador to Finland Wang Tongqing said that over the past 74 years, based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and win-win cooperation, bilateral relations have consistently maintained solid momentum, leading to fruitful cooperation results in various fields. ""We are prepared to enhance our traditional friendship with Finland, increase exchanges at all levels, and deepen practical cooperation in areas such as the forest industry, agriculture and food products, information and communications, energy and environmental protection, science, technology, education, and winter sports, in order to bring more benefits to our peoples,"" Wang said. In 1953, China and Finland inked a government-to-government trade and payment agreement, which was the first such agreement China signed with a Western country. Since then, Finland has become a pioneer and exemplar of practical economic and trade cooperation between China and Europe. Ambassador Wang had previously said that over the past 70 years, China and Finland have brought tangible benefits to their peoples in trade, investment and connectivity. Furthermore, Finland's green economy and silver economy have unique advantages and will be the future direction of cooperation between the two countries. As of 2023, China has been Finland's largest trading partner in Asia for 21 consecutive years. Finland is China's third-largest trading partner in the Nordic region. According to Chinese customs statistics, bilateral trade amounted to $8.2 billion last year, with China exporting $3.27 billion and importing $4.93 billion. Wang said that bilateral investment between China and Finland is also becoming increasingly active. China's unique advantage lies in its vast market demand and comprehensive industrial system, while Finland boasts strong overall competitiveness, advanced technological levels and a top-notch business environment. Finnish companies such as Valmet, a leading developer and supplier of process technologies, automation and services for the pulp, paper and energy industries, Stora Enso, a leading provider of renewable products in packaging, biomaterials and wooden construction, and escalator company Kone Corp have launched key investment projects in China.

An agreement was reached on Friday afternoon after ministers from Austria, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary signed a joint declaration in Budapest in a meeting held under the Hungarian rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. Romania and Bulgaria were granted partial Schengen status when passport checks to other Schengen countries were removed early this year at sea and air borders, but land border control had remained due to Vienna's opposition over the concern of excessive irregular migration. ""Bulgaria and Romania belong fully to the Schengen Area. Removing controls at land borders is the last hurdle,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a statement, adding that a European Council formal decision is next. European Council ministers are expected to meet next month to formalize the agreement. ""The citizens of Romania and Bulgaria belong to Schengen and deserve to fully benefit from Schengen freedoms,"" said European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson, who attended the Friday meeting of interior ministers in Budapest. She was hopeful that the land border checks would be completely removed by Jan 1, 2025. The joint declaration acknowledged the progress achieved in curbing irregular migration and asylum claims across the three countries. Comparing the first three quarters of 2023 and 2024, illegal entries have gone down by 47 percent in Bulgaria, 53 percent in Romania and 67 percent in Austria while asylum applications fell by 40 percent, 75 percent and 57 percent, respectively, in the three countries, according to the joint declaration. The three countries pledged, in the declaration, to continue the common efforts to fight illegal and irregular migration to Europe and their countries, do their utmost to prevent illegal onward transit of migrants through their countries and to smoothly conduct returns and transfers in accordance with the relevant agreements. Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner noted on Friday that there has been a massive drop in migrant arrival numbers, which are now ""moving toward zero"", but added that he would discuss the border measures with Chancellor Karl Nehammer before taking the final decision in December. ""Romanians have already felt the benefits of partial entry into the Schengen Area, but Romanian economic growth will be boosted with full accession, including by land,"" Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said in a statement on Friday. The full membership for Romania and Bulgaria will expand the Schengen Area to 29 states, including 25 EU member states. Ireland and Cyprus will remain the only EU members who are not part of the passport-free area. The latest breakthrough happened at a time when some 10 Schengen states such as Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Norway introduced temporary internal border checks over concerns of illegal migration.

28,China Focus: Researchers use AI algorithm to reveal hidden RNA viruses,"('Nobel',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\23\WS6718c1d7a310f1265a1c9319.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/23/WS6718c1d7a310f1265a1c9319.html,"BEIJING -- This year's Nobel Prize results signify that artificial intelligence (AI) technology is not only leading trends in computer science, but also has a growing impact in disciplines such as biology and chemistry. It offers scientists a new research approach: using AI to unlock the secrets of nature. One of the latest examples comes from virology. An international research team used AI technology to discover hundreds of thousands of RNA viruses from global ecosystems, showing the immense potential of AI algorithms in virus discovery and paving new paths for virology. A team of researchers from Sun Yat-sen University School of Medicine, as well as Zhejiang University, Guangzhou University, the University of Sydney and other institutions carried out the study, reporting the discovery of 180 RNA virus supergroups and over 160,000 global RNA virus species. The study, which was published recently in the journal Cell, is the largest RNA virus study to date, significantly expanding the knowledge about global RNA viruses. NEW AI ALGORITHM Viruses are an essential component of Earth's ecosystems and closely related to human health. However, the number of known virus species is still quite limited. Scientists can use gene sequencing technology to compare the similarity of unknown viruses with known viral nucleic acid sequences, thereby identifying new viruses. However, this method relies on the existing knowledge of viruses. When studying RNA viruses, which are highly divergent, numerous and prone to mutation, the method of sequence homology comparison couldn't work well anymore. The researchers have proposed a new solution using AI technology. According to Shi Mang from Sun Yat-sen University School of Medicine, who is also one of the corresponding authors of the research paper, the AI algorithm models can uncover viruses that were previously overlooked or not even known. ""During epidemics, the speed and accuracy of AI technology can help scientists quickly pinpoint potential pathogens,"" Shi said. He led the team to use a core algorithm dubbed LucaProt, a deep-learning Transformer model for the study. After extensive learning of viral and non-viral genomic sequences, it can autonomously form a set of criteria for virus identification to find viral sequences from large RNA sequencing datasets. NEW RNA VIRUS SPECIES According to the study, LucaProt demonstrated high accuracy and specificity, with a false positive rate of 0.014 percent and a false negative rate of 1.72 percent. The team conducted viral search on 10,487 RNA sequencing data from global biological environmental samples, and discovered over 510,000 viral genomes representing more than 160,000 potential viral species and 180 supergroups of RNA viruses. Among them, 23 supergroups could not be identified by traditional sequence homology methods. They can be referred to as the ""dark matter"" of the viral community. The study found that these viruses are distributed across various ecological environments on Earth. The highest viral diversity is found in leaf litter, wetlands, freshwater, and wastewater environments. Considerable virus diversity and abundance are also found in extreme environments such as antarctic sediments, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, activated sludge, and saline-alkali wastelands. According to Hou Xin, the first author of the paper, these viruses include not only pathogens that infect humans but also those that exist in the environment and infect various organisms. They can infect a variety of animals, plants, single-celled protists, fungi and bacteria. ""A deeper understanding of viruses in the environment can help us better study the workings of the entire ecosystem. Moreover, we can use this method to discover viruses closely related to human diseases for the surveillance and early warning of emerging diseases,"" Hou said. ""The traditional classification system has become inadequate for the new viruses, whose diversity far exceeds human imagination. What we see now is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Shi said. NEW TOOL FOR MORE STUDIES It is a model specifically designed for discovering RNA viruses, but it also integrates the ability to recognize protein sequences and implicit structural information, and can be used to identify protein functions. According to the study, the LucaProt model helped researchers identify genomic structures beyond previous virus knowledge, revealing the flexibility of RNA virus genomic evolution. It also revealed a variety of viral functional proteins, especially those related to bacteria, indicating that there are more types of RNA bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, to be explored. The research team has open-sourced the model and shared it with scientists worldwide online. Li Zhaorong from Apsara Lab of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, another corresponding author, believed that AI is gradually changing the way scientists tackle various scientific challenges. ""This model is becoming a cutting-edge tool in virus identification and is also being applied to other types of protein identification and discovery of functions,"" Li said. Xu Jianguo, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that the success of LucaProt marks a breakthrough for AI algorithms in virus discovery.

32,China's EV industry driving global green development,"('Nordic',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202405\09\WS663c103da31082fc043c60b4.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202405/09/WS663c103da31082fc043c60b4.html,"Certain US and European politicians have been pointing fingers at China's electric vehicle industry. However, it is absurd for them to criticize China's EV sector, which plays a significant role in driving global green development. Electric vehicles (EVs), and their pricing, carbon emissions reduction, longevity and availability are the common topics of discussion in many circles. All EVs, also called new energy vehicles (NEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. There are also plug-in hybrid EVs and fuel-cell EVs. Unlike traditional vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce emissions because they run on rechargeable electric batteries. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) produce no tailpipe emissions and operate without a combustion engine. As the world transitions from ""global warming"" to ""global boiling"", it is essential to embrace new energy vehicles as a means to mitigate emissions. The global EV market is advancing rapidly. In 2023, for example, about 13.6 million EVs were sold worldwide. Global sales are forecast to grow by 25-30 percent this year, with McKinsey predicting worldwide EV demand to grow six-fold from 2021 to 2030. BEVs and plug-in hybrid EVs represented 15.8 percent of global light vehicle sales last year, with China boasting the highest market share of NEVs followed by the Nordic countries. The fastest-growing markets included Turkiye, Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia, and Australia. China's role in combating global warming in this regard should be appreciated rather than chided. It's true China is the leader in EV production and sales. It not only produced and sold the highest number of EVs (9.58 million and 9.49 million units respectively), but also exported 1.2 million EVs last year. And it is expected to produce 11.5 million and export 5.5 million EVs this year. It should be noted that China's export of EVs have been rapidly increasing due to their quality and performance, rather than due to overcapacity. Some Western politicians often attempt to deny China's market economy status. Instead of doing that, they should embrace a more open global market, allowing market forces to determine market share and enabling consumers to decide which products to purchase. China's growing share of the EV market globally is a result of natural market forces and healthy competition. What's more, China's EV sector also contributes to global technology development. The country has made its EV production process more efficient by building special industry and supply chains, and large industry clusters in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and the Chengdu-Chongqing regions. Over the past decade, China has invested massively to further develop EV technology, and its policies and technological advancements have contributed immensely to its success in the global EV market. In particular, China's advancements in battery technology have been a game changer. And while China has established the world\'s largest battery manufacturing value chain, Chinese EV-makers have spent billions of dollars to develop smart car features to make their vehicles safer and more comfortable for consumers, by adding more features such as AI-powered smart car systems, and helping improve the voice recognition and automated parking systems. They are also investing in new features to connect their EVs to phones and home appliances in what is being called a ""Human x Car x Home"" ecosystem. In fact, Chinese EV-makers are offering feature-rich, technologically advanced vehicles at competitive prices with strong after-sales support. Competitors should adhere to market rules and ensure a level playing field for all market participants. China's EV-maker BYD overtook US funded Tesla as the world's biggest EV-making company last year, and China overtook Japan as the world's largest car exporter. What US and EU politicians should do is to refrain from accusing China's EV sector under the guise of safeguarding national security, and instead allow market players to make their own choice. Just as Elon Musk is increasing investment and participating in the competition in the Chinese market. However, some countries and automakers are worried about China's success in the global EV market, though they understand that it's not easy to compete with China, as it has established an efficient technological innovation ecosystem and has a huge production capacity. The US and the EU, which benefited from automobile trade for many decades, are now trying to restrict China's EV exports to their markets in an act of economic bullying. While the European Commission recently launched an anti-subsidy investigation into EV imports to find an excuse to stop Chinese EVs from entering the EU market, the US has been complaining about the oversupply of EVs. But as long as consumers in the developed economies are satisfied with Chinese EVs, it will not be easy for the US and the EU to stop China from leading the global EV market.

The second seed built a three-game advantage before Kallberg responded in the fourth. The 19-year-old Chinese player then delivered the decisive blow in game five to secure victory. Leaving Frankfurt with another trophy, Lin continues his incredible run, building on his triumphs at the WTT Contender Almaty, Champions Macao, China Smash, and Contender Muscat.

The Smart City Expo World Congress, dedicated to enhancing urban quality of life globally, honored Shenzhen for its advancements in digital transformation, sustainable development, and innovative urban management. Once a small fishing village, Shenzhen has transformed over the past 40 years into a modern international metropolis. With a population of 17.66 million, the city is globally recognized as a leader in leveraging technology to enhance public services and improve urban management. Its initiatives prioritize digitalization and sustainable solutions, setting a benchmark for smart city development worldwide. The Smart City Expo drew over 1,100 exhibitors and 600 experts from around the world, focusing on strategies and solutions to make cities more sustainable, efficient, and livable. Key topics included mobility, public services, energy, utilities, and citizen engagement. The expo showcased cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality, sensors, and autonomous vehicles, all designed to enhance urban living. Among the highlights are smart bus shelters, advanced street lighting, solar-powered bicycles, and flying taxi prototypes, illustrating the potential of tech-driven solutions in city development. According to event director Ugo Valenti, over 25,000 attendees from 850 cities worldwide participated in the expo. ""They came to learn, exchange ideas, do business, and build networks that will help them transform their cities,"" Valenti said. ""It\'s inspiring to see how we\'re contributing to a better world."" Over 50 Chinese companies participated in the expo, with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) hosting a pavilion that showcased 28 companies. Cai Mingyong, a CCPIT representative, said the event provided a platform to highlight China's scientific and technological advancements, as well as Chinese companies' commitment to openness and international collaboration. In response to the recent deadly floods in Spain - the worst in over five decades - the expo also spotlighted disaster management innovations. One notable solution is an early warning flood prevention system developed by Swedish company Axis Communications, demonstrating the vital role of technology in addressing natural catastrophes. The Software Republique consortium unveiled an electric ""pop-up"" vehicle that can be configured as a mobile medical center with AI assistance. According to Julien Philibert, program manager at Renault/Software Republique, this vehicle can assist in locating nearby doctors and facilitate video communication and data checks through an AI-powered nurse. ""The fact that some of the solutions presented here helped in the response to the Valencia flooding is proof that our efforts are making a tangible difference,"" Valenti said. ""This event has certified that our mission to foster sustainable and livable cities is more crucial than ever."" The expo is organized by the trade fair organization Fira de Barcelona.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/08/672d6b78a310f1268d847609.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/08/672d6b78a310f1268d84760b.jpeg']","['A Hong Kong citizen uses drone delivery service at Futian Port in Shenzhen, South China\'s Guangdong province, Oct 23, 2024.

Sun earned 2,000 points from her win at the World Table Tennis (WTT) China Smash which concluded on Sunday, improving her tally to a record-high 10,800 points. The ITTF applied changes to its world ranking regulations in 2022, as the world ranking of a player is essentially composed of the sum of the points of the best eight results achieved in the last 12 months.

36,China's ship sails steadily toward its destination,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202409\23\WS66f0a60ca3103711928a91eb.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/23/WS66f0a60ca3103711928a91eb.html,"""China can only do well when the world is doing well. When China does well, the world will get even better,"" President Xi Jinping said in his keynote speech at the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in 2023. The 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China conjures the image of a gigantic ship with 1.4 billion passengers sailing in stormy weather at times and calm waters at others, with the captain steadfastly keeping the compass needle in the direction of the destination. The destination, in this case, is the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. While the ship will continue its journey from there on to new and more fascinating destinations, its journey till now is already a remarkable achievement with no precedent in history. It is fascinating for me as someone living in a small country like Sweden with less than 11 million people to think how a country as large as China with a massive population could move steadily in one direction. The outcome of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China showed how the country's leadership has managed, especially since the launch of reform and opening-up in 1978, to maneuver the ship of the State from one destination to another, while overcoming challenges and making remarkable achievements on the way to building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Along the way, many internal problems including air, water and soil pollution, and unbalanced urban and rural development have emerged. On the international front, major crises like the global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the global inflation crisis have been severe headwinds that the ship has had to endure. But it never veered from its course. Equally amazing is the fact that China has risen to such global prominence economically and politically without waging wars on its neighbours or even those who consider the country a threat and a rival. In contrast, China's rise has contributed to global stability. In the past centuries, modernization and industrialization in Europe, and the West generally, but even in Japan, although great and beneficial to humankind in many ways, have been associated with colonization, imperialism, destructive wars and the rule of the jungle. China is a great exception, because it has not used any of the dubious means of the West to achieve its unprecedented development. The world today is in dire need of a peaceful mechanism for not only resolving crises but also to ensure countries coexist peacefully. And China's success in diplomatically bridging the gap between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023 is a shining example of such a potential. Its success in bringing 14 different Palestinian factions together on a unified policy and calling for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tragedy in the Gaza Strip in accordance with international law is another example. The world benefits from the Chinese philosophy of harmonizing and creating a holistic structure within which a multitude of diverse issues can be resolved. Chinese leaders reiterated recently that the country must pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, help build a community with a shared future for mankind, respect human values, and promote the Belt and Road Initiative along with the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. The world, especially the major Western powers, has tried to resolve most of the strategic challenges and threats using security and military means. Not only has method failed to resolve any of the issues but also it made things even worse, leading to the loss of more lives and resources. The US-led NATO's 20-year occupation of Afghanistan is a stark reminder of the futility of this approach. Neglecting socioeconomic development is a fatal error, which China has been warning against, and leading by example to show that security issues are entangled with economic, social and even cultural development. Economic cooperation and cultural exchanges, including people-to-people exchanges, must become the beacon guiding countries toward security and peace as they sail in stormy waters. The recently concluded Summit of the China-Africa Forum on Cooperation was a reminder of the effectiveness of Chinese diplomacy through economic cooperation. The FOCAC Summit also showed what is meant by a community with a shared future. Many mistake it for mere rhetoric, but in reality it is a notion of common prosperity and common good. China is acutely aware that its current and future prosperity depends on the prosperity of other countries, including African countries, but equally importantly on global peace and stability. China has advanced rapidly in recent decades, but to continue moving forward, it needs to be joined by the rest of the world. It was in this sense that President Xi recently invoked an African proverb: If you want to go fast, walk alone, if you want to go far, walk together.

37,"China, Russia navigate in Arctic cooperation","('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\01\WS67240f7da310f1265a1cac1c.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/01/WS67240f7da310f1265a1cac1c.html,"The opportunities for Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic region are significant in several areas. The Arctic is home to vast, untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. China, with its growing energy demand, is keen to secure a stable supply of these resources, including from the Arctic  even though Russia, which lacks capital and technology for large-scale oil and gas extraction, also stands to benefit from Chinese investment and technological support. The melting of Arctic ice due to climate change has made the Northern Sea Route more accessible, which could significantly shorten the shipping distance between Asia and Europe, while reducing the time and investment for global trade. Russia, which controls this route, sees the Arctic as a good opportunity to boost its economic development. As for China, it views the Northern Sea Route as an essential component of its Belt and Road Initiative, particularly the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. But despite the potential benefits, there are several challenges and uncertainties that make the long-term success of Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic difficult to predict. From a geopolitical perspective, the United States and its allies are likely to view Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic with suspicion, potentially leading to increased strategic competition in the region. Some NATO member states could even impose sanctions on or take diplomatic actions against China and Russia to disrupt their collaboration in the Arctic, especially if they perceive the moves made by China and Russia as a ""threat ""to the existing balance of power in the Arctic region. For example, following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022, Finland and Sweden changed their longstanding military non-alignment policy, eventually joining NATO in April 2023 and March 2024, respectively. Besides, US troops stationed in Alaska are advancing to become the US military\'s ""Arctic force"", and holding joint exercises with countries like Norway, Canada, Finland and Sweden. While China and Russia have quite a few common interests in the Arctic, their relations face certain historical and strategic challenges, which could limit the scope and depth of their cooperation. Among the other challenges the China-Russia partnership faces are building the necessary infrastructure for the Northern Sea Route, and extracting resources in harsh Arctic conditions, including extreme cold and extensive ice cover. These tasks are not only very difficult but also very expensive. Also, the fluctuating global energy market could affect the feasibility and profitability of such ventures. The stalling of Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project is among the economic fallouts of the Ukraine crisis. Moscow's enthusiasm for developing the Northern Sea Route is largely driven by a pressing need to offset the economic impact of Western sanctions. The Northern Sea Route offers Russia a strategic alternative to traditional maritime routes that are more vulnerable to sanctions and geopolitical pressures. For Russia, the Northern Sea Route represents a means of sustaining and expanding its economic ties with Asia, particularly China, while reinforcing its sovereignty and control over the resource-rich Arctic region. However, China sees the Northern Sea Route as a valuable alternative to the traditional shipping routes like the Suez Canal, but not an essential one. China's broader strategy involves securing multiple trade routes and diversifying its energy supplies to reduce dependency on any single route. Therefore, despite being interested in the Northern Sea Route, China is not as heavily invested in its development as Russia. Besides, Chinese companies involved in the Northern Sea Route face significant risks due to ongoing geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West. As such, China must balance its interest in the Northern Sea Route with the broader implications of its actions in the Arctic. While the Northern Sea Route offers potential economic benefits, these must be weighed against the risks of Chinese enterprises becoming entangled in the geopolitical rivalry between Russia and the West. Consequently, China's approach to the Northern Sea Route is likely to remain cautious, focusing on opportunities that align with its broader strategic goals while avoiding actions that could invite Western retaliation. In addition, while China has made significant strides in technology, it lacks the capability to operate effectively in the Arctic. Russia, too, faces limitations in terms of technology, particularly in offshore drilling. Overcoming these hurdles will require substantial investment and time  even then the success of these ventures is not guaranteed. However, this also presents an opportunity for both countries to engage in joint technological innovation, particularly in areas such as ice-resistant infrastructure, advanced navigation systems, and sustainable resource extraction techniques. Environmental concerns, too, loom large on Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic. Spills or accidents could have catastrophic consequences, leading to international condemnation and potentially stringent regulations. Environmental concerns may also prompt indigenous communities and global environmental organizations to oppose the exploration of the Arctic. The success of this cooperation will largely depend on how both countries navigate these complex challenges while balancing their national interests with the broader geopolitical dynamics of the Arctic. Another challenge lies in the legal realm. The Arctic is governed by a complex web of international laws and agreements, most notably the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As China and Russia expand their activities in the region, they may encounter legal issues with Arctic nations over resource rights and shipping lanes. The ability of China and Russia to navigate these legal frameworks, while securing their interests, will be crucial to the long-term success of their cooperation. The success of Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic will largely depend on how both countries navigate these complex challenges while balancing their national interests with the broader geopolitical dynamics of the Arctic region.

But Ye Wocheng and Liu Kaiwen will forge a career path for themselves in Canada this summer after both qualified for the PGA Tour's international circuit by performing well at the qualifying tournament in Weston, Florida, that concluded last Friday. Ye finished second, and Liu tied for seventh. While both players are more than familiar with golf in China and in the US, Canada will be a new experience for both. Ye currently lives in the Orlando suburb of Winter Park, and if there were any doubts he was going to qualify for one of the available playing positions, he ended that with his superb 6-under 66 on the final day that left him alone in second place behind winner Alex Herrmann of Germany. Ye is exempt from all tournaments in the first half of the season and will play the entire season if he is able to make a couple of cuts. Liu finished 72 holes tied for seventh with five other players, and with only nine membership cards available, he was one of the five in a sudden-death playoff for the final three spots. Liu survived that extra session-with Parker Gillam and David Sanders-to earn the same playing privileges as Ye. The PGA Tour Canada season begins June 2-5 in Victoria, British Columbia, and concludes Sep 15-18 in Kitchener, Ontario. Liu shot opening and closing 71s at The Club at Weston Hills and added a 4-under 68 and a 3-over 75.Liu, who was born in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province, but was educated in the US, attending college in California. ""I am excited. I am satisfied with my performance this week. I think I have time to do more training before the tournament starts this season. I very much look forward to it,"" he said. Liu played collegiately at the University of California, a golf powerhouse. In Berkeley, he was teammates for two seasons with current PGA Tour player Colin Morikawa. Liu attended the same high school-Torrey Pines High-that produced LPGA player He Muni, originally from Chengdu, Sichuan province. Ye, a native of Dongguan, Guangdong province, rose to fame in 2013 when, as a 12-year-old, he qualified for the DP World Tour's Volvo China Open, becoming the youngest player to compete on the circuit, formerly known as the European Tour. Three years later, he made the cut in the same tournament as a 15-year-old, tying for 59th. He played collegiate golf at the University of Florida and at No 497 in the world is the seventh-ranked player from the Chinese mainland, behind only Yuan Yechun, Dou Zecheng, Li Haotong, Wu Ashun, amateur Ding Wenyi and Chen Guxin. In the final round of the Canada Qualifying Tournament, Ye got off to a flier, with an eagle at No 1 and a birdie at No 2. He added three more birdies the rest of the way for a tournament-best 66. ""This will be a good tour for me to continue to play and learn,"" Ye said. ""I missed playing many events in the previous two years because of the pandemic.

45,Discrimination fails to stop my musical journey,"('ABBA',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202312\07\WS65718fa3a31090682a5f2034.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202312/07/WS65718fa3a31090682a5f2034.html,"Nine out of 10 Asian Americans have personally experienced discrimination, according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center. In light of this, I would like to recount an incident that I experienced years ago. I have been hesitant to discuss my musical background since arriving in Shenyang in 2008, and have had minimal involvement in music writing or performance. However, it was not until living in China for more than a decade, a problem began to emerge - something I didn't even notice at the outset. But lets first go back to the period before arriving in China. In 2003, I left New York City to pursue my music dreams and relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. I secured a one-way Greyhound bus ticket that transported me from my hometown and left my mother, and friends behind. Thankfully, upon arrival, Eric Wilson and his family generously provided me with accommodations. Wilson, a celebrated suspense writer, was someone I knew through a connection I had made before undertaking my journey to Tennessee. Lacking a driver's license as a 20-something American-born Chinese, navigating Nashville, or Music City of the US., proved to be a hurdle. Nonetheless, I overcame this obstacle and established connections within the city's music scene, in spite of my minority status in the state. Unknown to me, these experiences in Nashville were merely a small portion of my songwriting journey. Looking back to the time before I moved to Nashville, I fondly recall the moments when Ronnie Oliver Jr, a conductor and educator, would patiently review my sheet music and annotate my errors with a pencil. Although it was initially hard for me to carry out his corrections, his advice greatly developed my songwriting skills. Previously, my music was too emotional, but he kept me on track with proper artistic form and structure. Through his mentorship, my musical composition improved significantly because of his guidance. Every generation has notable recording artists whose beliefs and backgrounds distinguish them apart. I fall into that category, much like Bob Dylan and others. Their personal faith serves as a foundation that has brought some of our times' best music to light. Meanwhile, others draw inspiration from traumatic events that shape the essence of their musical fit. These elements have created an energetic drive that appeals with the rising public opinion toward musical expression. As a child, my mother, a second generation Chinese American, introduced and filled my ears with a broad array of musical genres, such as The Carpenters, Don Mclean, Paul Simon, ABBA, Eagles, and many other artists. I expanded my music collection by watching VH1's music video countdowns in addition to my mother's musical preferences, which developed my fundamental comprehension of musical composition. Nevertheless, it wasn't until I pursued formal music education that I truly refined my craft. During my time in Nashville, I recall receiving an invitation to a Thanksgiving meal in Franklin, Tennessee, a location situated south of the capital. The family was gracious and welcoming during my stay. I participated in a household meal and had a confidential discussion about my music career with the hosts husband in the living room, away from the dining area. He kindly informed me that being an American citizen of Chinese descent could pose challenges in the music industry and there are no known ways to effectively market such artists to public. As an alternative, he suggested a career as a recording artist manager. He also hinted that my vocals could improve with age. Although I initially dismissed his comments, I later felt their impact while living in China. For a while, everything was running smoothly, and upon my decision to live in Shenyang, Liaoning province, China, I acquired a guitar. From time to time, I would strum my guitar and sing a tune out of the blue. Later on, Xiong Yudi, a former student from my English Spokenology studies who was aware of my musical background and also created music, urged me to resume composing. With Xiong's encouragement and another reason in mind, I made the choice to pursue it. On December 22, 2020, I resumed composing music and lyrics. By January 31 of the following year, I launched my debut original track on Netease Music, a prevalent app for streaming music and music videos. Fans of my music may recognize the distinctive style of my songwriting, but may notice that my lyrical approach differs. I aim to avoid overwhelming content and instead strive for simplicity, allowing listeners to easily catch the words and relate on a personal level. This approach ultimately extends my reach to a wider audience of music lovers. At the start of my writing in Shenyang, I concentrated on a theme related to love. However, this year I've explored various topics including a song dedicated to a friend, a melody for a birthday celebration, a lullaby, composition supporting disaster relief efforts, and as well as pieces inspired by popular films and specific travel destinations. After spending well over 10 years in China since 2008, I realized the discomfort due to remarks made by the individual in Franklin. Rather than dwelling on the discouragement, I eventually understood he was hinting that I continue my music career at a later date. Only in recent years has everything slowly fallen into place. I recall my friend Lew Tabackin once said to me after I settled down in Shenyang, ""I hope you are well and have found your calling."" It took me quite a while to find what I love the most - songwriting. On July 11 of this year, I was thrilled to release my 50th original song on Netease Music. After taking a break from songwriting, I resumed it about three years ago and now earn a modest income from it. My current objective is to produce up to 100 songs within the next two and a half to three years. Ultimately, I aspire, perhaps to become a Grammy Award-winning songwriter, but I hope that discriminatory or restrictive factors will not impede my progress. Likewise, I extend this wish to everyone globally, that they are treated equitably and fairly. Luke Shen-Tien Chi, an American-born Chinese spokenologist and writer.

46,Door opened wider for foreign-invested businesses,"('Swedish',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\27\WS67465975a310f1265a1cfbda.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/27/WS67465975a310f1265a1cfbda.html,"When discussing the pace of innovation in China, Matthew Ye, the local head of French tire and mobility company Michelin, offers a perspective that differs from many senior executives in other parts of the world. Collaborating with Chinese electric vehicle companies and traditional car manufacturers has become more demanding in terms of response speed and technical requirements compared with the past, said Ye, CEO and president of Michelin China and Mongolia. ""As a result, I must spend more time to push our local, European and Japanese engineers in China to accelerate their innovation efforts,"" Ye said, adding that the company will continue to expand passenger car tire production capacity at its factories in Shanghai and Shenyang, Liaoning province, to meet the country\'s surging demand. With a similar outlook, Josh Weiss, president of the manufacturing intelligence division at Hexagon AB, said the Swedish industrial group will put its new South China headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, with investment of more than 200 million euros ($214.38 million), into operation by the end of 2025. Along with supporting the company and its partners' manufacturing businesses in China, the facility will provide solutions for clients in Southeast Asia and other Asian countries. With China creating more favorable conditions to transform and modernize traditional industries and cultivate emerging sectors, market watchers and executives from multinational corporations are confident about the substantial growth opportunities and greater commercial engagement in the world's second-largest economy. Recent policy measures to remove all market access restrictions for foreign investors in the manufacturing sector are expected to prompt foreign companies to increase their investments in China, with a focus on high-end manufacturing and innovation, they said. 'Negative list' update The latest edition of China's national negative list for foreign investment, which took effect on Nov 1, removed the last two manufacturing-related restrictions, according to the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner. The items on the latest negative list, which specifies fields that are off-limits to foreign investors, have been further reduced to 29. Another negative list applied in the country's free trade zones, which involve pioneering pilots in opening-up practices, achieved zero restrictions on foreign investment in manufacturing in 2021. Wang Xing, a partner expert at management consultancy Roland Berger, believes that these opening-up moves have significant strategic importance. The updated national negative list, in conjunction with other policies aimed at attracting overseas capital, not only demonstrates China's determination to deepen reforms, but also creates a better investment and business environment for foreign companies. They are key measures for the integration of Chinese industries into the global economy, said Wang. ""In the current complex geopolitical environment, many multinational corporations are reconfiguring their global manufacturing bases and supply chain layouts,"" said Wang. Numerous companies are actively establishing ""lighthouse factories""  advanced manufacturing facilities recognized for their leadership in applying cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation, efficiency and sustainability in production  across China. These investments cater not only to the Chinese market, but also strive to bolster overall global competitiveness and digital transformation, he added. Lighthouse factories can effectively optimize operations, and significantly reduce waste, energy consumption and production costs while boosting productivity, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The manufacturing industry was the earliest sector in China to open up to foreign investors and is also the most competitive and closely coordinated one in terms of the global industrial division of labor. Scaling up high-tech manufacturing can help China enhance the value-added component of its economy and secure its position in global value chains. This will move China away from reliance on low-cost, labor-intensive industries, said Zhao Ping, dean of the academy at China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in Beijing. ""A well-established supply chain and infrastructure for high-tech industries make it easier for foreign companies to set up operations and integrate into local ecosystems,"" said Zhao. ""By prioritizing innovation, China grants opportunities for collaboration in research and development, which appeals to multinational corporations seeking to advance their technologies."" Confident outlook Attracted by these factors, German investment in China has reached a record high so far this year, and again reaffirmed the confidence German companies have in the Chinese market, said Clas Neumann, chairperson of the board of German Chamber of Commerce in China, East China. Currently, around 5,000 German companies operate in China, while over 2,000 Chinese companies have invested in Germany. The industrial and supply chains of both China and Germany are deeply integrated and their markets are highly interdependent, according to information released by the chamber. With the structure of foreign investment continuing to be optimized, China saw the high-tech manufacturing sector utilize 80.18 billion yuan ($11.07 billion) in foreign direct investment between January and October this year, accounting for 11.6 percent of the national total, data from the Ministry of Commerce shows. That represents an increase of 0.7 percentage points from the same period last year. Investment in China from Germany, Australia and Singapore has also increased, surging by 7.5 percent, 6 percent and 4.4 percent respectively year-on-year. Expressing long-term confidence in the Chinese market, German carmaker BMW Group announced in April an additional investment of 20 billion yuan in its production base in Shenyang. In September, French industrial group Schneider Electric SE completed the second phase of an innovation laboratory park project in Shanghai. US chipmaker Intel Corp announced in late October the expansion of its packaging and testing base in Chengdu, Sichuan province, along with a $300 million capital injection for its subsidiary there. Eager to expand its market share in China, Trane Technologies plc, a US manufacturer of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems, put a new plant into operation in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, in mid-November. With an investment of 300 million yuan, the facility not only aims to enhance the company's production capacity in China but also to supply products to other markets in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India. Noting that China is one of Trane Technologies' key growth markets globally, Wu Chuangang, the group's vice-president of operations and integrated supply chain for the Asia-Pacific region, said that the company has maintained double-digit growth in China over the past three years, demonstrating strong business performance. ""The new factory will introduce additional product lines, particularly temperature control products, in the coming years, which are expected to drive further business growth,"" he added. Chen Jianwei, a researcher at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics\' Academy of China Open Economy Studies, said: ""By actively engaging in global industrial division and reinforcing multilateral, bilateral and regional economic cooperation, China has played a key role in maintaining a diversified and stable international economic framework."" The nation's ongoing progress in market openness, business model transformation, and industrial, consumption and large-scale equipment upgrades, will consolidate its position as a strategic priority for global manufacturing businesses, fostering sustainable long-term financial growth, he said. Customized solutions That sentiment is in line with the latest trade figures. Exports of foreign-invested businesses in China amounted to 5.77 trillion yuan between January and October of 2024, marking year-on-year growth of 1.9 percent, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. With more Chinese firms rushing to adopt new equipment to cut carbon emissions and boost productivity, Swiss technology company ABB Ltd said it will focus on developing more customized solutions for local clients, with plans to extend these innovations to other parts of the world. Joachim Braun, president of ABB process industries, said that process industries serve the steel and nonferrous metals, mining, pulp and paper, and cement sectors, all of which hold a significant global share in China. ""Therefore, if you are active in these sectors, the Chinese market naturally plays a crucial role. We believe that the outlook for the Chinese market will be fairly positive over the next three years,"" said Braun. Apart from extensive production on a global scale, quality upgrades and decarbonization will become key drivers for further development in China, making ABB quite optimistic about future demands in this market, Braun added. Tsuyoshi Nishiwaki, chairman of China trading at ASICS Corp, a Japanese sportswear manufacturer, said as China, along with Europe, North America and Japan, is one of the group's four major global markets, the company will continue to invest in the Chinese market. China's consumption trends present a significant growth opportunity, and ASICS is actively responding to them through a combination of market expansion and localization, said Tsuyoshi, who is also the company's senior managing director for China. ""We are firmly committed to further investing in the Chinese market through local product development, digital transformation and national initiatives, strengthening our position in China and meeting the evolving needs of Chinese consumers,"" he added. Wang Xiaohong, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said China is already established as a key export hub for many foreign corporations, and this has generated numerous growth points for businesses, including those in the service sector. On Nov 21, US express transport company Federal Express Corp announced more frequent international cargo flights between Xiamen, Fujian province, and the US, along with the inauguration of its Xiamen international gateway facility. These initiatives will enhance FedEx's network in China and empower local businesses to capitalize on global trade opportunities with more efficient and intelligent logistics services and solutions, said Poh-Yian Koh, senior vice-president of FedEx and president of FedEx China. In addition to the removal of all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, China has also vowed to further shorten the negative list for foreign investment this year, with market access restrictions in services sectors such as telecommunications and healthcare to be reduced. In September, steps were announced to expand opening-up in the medical field, including giving the greenlight for the establishment of wholly foreign-owned hospitals in selected cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The government also decided in late October to allow foreign investors to operate wholly-owned businesses such as internet data centers and to engage in online data processing and transaction processing in certain areas, as part of a pilot program to expand opening-up in value-added telecom services.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/27/67465975a310f1268d85a9c7.jpeg'],['WANG YANGYANG/FOR CHINA DAILY'],2024-11-27 07:27,ZHONG NAN,"The article reports on the ongoing efforts of Chinese companies to increase their market share and improve their competitiveness in the global economy.

Warholm may have been behind one of the most iconic moments in Olympic history when he smashed a 29-year-old world record to win the 400m hurdles at the Tokyo Games in a time of 45.94 sec. But the 26-year-old came to Eugene on the back of a hamstring injury which ultimately put paid to his medal hopes. Instead, Brazilian Dos Santos ran the third fastest time of all time and a championship record of 46.29 to win gold ahead of Americans Rai Benjamin and Trevor Bassitt. ""It\'s pretty awesome to win the world title on this track. I didn\'t care about the time because this is the first time I\'ve won a world title,"" said Dos Santos. Warholm led coming into the home straight but seized up badly and eventually came in seventh (48.42), breaking a winning streak of 22 races, including 18 finals, dating back to September 2018. ""It was a very tough race,"" Warholm said. ""I had an injury but to me it\'s always your fight and giving your all and leaving it all on the track. ""I felt I did that. I hope looking back I\'ll feel proud of that even though I prefer to take a medal."" While everyone knew Warholm was coming back from injury, serious hopes were pinned on Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the men's 1,500m. But Wightman had not read the script, playing the Norwegian at his own game by kicking with 200 meters to run and holding his form through to the line. Wightman sealed victory in 3 min 29.23 sec, with Ingebrigtsen taking silver in 3:29.47 and Spaniard Mohamed Katir claiming bronze (3:29.90). Family affair In a bizarre twist, Wightman's father Geoff is in Eugene doing the in-stadium commentary. Geoff, also his son\'s coach, was reduced to a cracked voice as he announced to Hayward Field: ""That\'s my son and he\'s world champion."" ""For him to be part of my journey to get to this point, and actually part of the actual race itself is so unique,"" Wightman said of his father. ""I talked to him and he\'s very happy. I\'m glad he showed some emotion."" Following on from Norway's Olympic gold medalists in failing to nail a world title was 2019 champion Daniel Stahl. The Swede eventually finished fourth in the discus. Australian Eleanor Patterson won high-jump gold in the fourth final of the night with 2.02 meters on countback from Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh. Italy's Elena Vallortigara took bronze. Fred flops Day five of action at the worlds also saw newly crowned 100m champion Fred Kerley fail to advance from the semifinals of the 200m. The American set off smoothly from the blocks but was left grimacing as he hit the home straight, eventually winding up sixth in 20.68 seconds. The 27-year-old later said he cramped up in the latter stages of the race, but insisted he would be fit to race in the relays. ""Bit of cramp, but it\'s all good,"" Kerley said. ""I\'m not in pain, I\'ll be good."" While Kerley was left digesting a disappointing early exit, there were no such worries for defending 200m world champion Noah Lyles, who romped home in his semifinal with a blistering 19.62. The main threat to Lyles' hopes of retaining his 200m title may well come from teenage teammate and emerging rival Erriyon Knighton, and Kenneth Bednarek. There was no such drama for Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who kept her bid for a sprint double on track as she sailed into the final of the women's 200m. Fresh from winning a record fifth world 100m title, Fraser-Pryce timed a season's best of 21.83 in the third of three semifinals. Joining the 35-year-old, a world 200m champion in 2013, in Thursday's final will be her teammates Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, who helped snatch an unprecedented clean sweep of the 100m podium for Jamaica on Sunday. Alongside the trio of Jamaicans in the final will be Britain's Dina Asher-Smith, the reigning world 200m champion who was fourth in the 100m, Americans Abby Steiner and Tamara Clark, Niger's Aminatou Seyni and Switzerland's Mujinga Kambundji.

There was little to play for in Group A3 going into the final day. The Germans had already wrapped up top spot. The Dutch were secure in second and Hungary sat four points ahead of the already-relegated Bosnia. ""With a win, we would\'ve gone into the break with a nicer feeling, but we can still be very satisfied about what we achieved in 2024 and can kick things off again in March,"" said German midfielder Robert Andrich. In Group B4, a 4-1 victory for Wales against Iceland ensured automatic promotion to the top division at the expense of Turkiye, which went down 3-1 in Montenegro. Czech Republic booked top spot in Group B1 with a 2-1 win over Georgia. Ukraine leapfrogged the Georgians into second place by downing Albania. In Budapest, Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann rang the changes with his team having confirmed top spot last week with a 7-0 thumping of Bosnia. It was Felix Nmecha who broke the goalless stalemate when he prodded home from inside the six-yard box with 14 minutes of the match remaining. Germany seemed set to close out its fifth win in six outings until the seventh minute of injury time. VAR decided that Robin Koch had committed a handball in the box and Hungarian captain Szoboszlai stepped up two minutes later to dink home from 12 yards. ""It\'s been a real rollercoaster of a year, but I believe that, with this match, we can go into 2025 in good spirits,"" said Szoboszlai. The Netherlands finished five points behind its historic rival, as it was held to a draw in Zenica. Brian Brobbey headed in the opener for Ronald Koeman's side midway through the first period, but, despite dominating the rest of the half, the Dutch were unable to double their lead. The Oranje were made to pay in the 67th minute when Hamburgborn Bosnian attacker Ermedin Demirovic adjusted his body magnificently to nod a rebound over goalkeeper Mark Flekken. ""I\'m not satisfied with a point. I think we had to win,"" said Koeman. Wales 'really happy' Wales bounced back from an early Andri Gudjohnsen goal in Cardiff to put four past Iceland and jump into first place in Group B4. ""It\'s something we set out to do,"" Wales\' Liam Cullen told Welsh broadcaster S4C. ""We knew we couldn\'t control what was going on in the Turkiye game, but we really wanted to put our stamp on this game and win convincingly, so really happy that we\'ve done that."" Swansea City striker Cullen scored a double to put the host in front by halftime, before Brennan Johnson and Harry Wilson put the gloss on the win inside the final half-hour. Wales needed victory to have any chance of obtaining automatic promotion to League A, but it also needed an unlikely Montenegro upset of Turkiye to guarantee top spot with a one-point buffer. The soccer gods smiled on the Dragons, as Nikola Krstovic's hat-trick in Niksic condemned Turkiye to the playoffs and allowed Montenegro to pick up its first points of the campaign after five consecutive defeats. Two 2-1 wins flipped Group B1 on its head after three points had separated the four teams going into the final round. Ukraine was fourth before its trip to Tirana, but two goals in the first 10 minutes from Oleksandr Zinchenko and Roman Yaremchuk gave it the perfect start. A Nedim Bajrami penalty gave Albania hope in the last quarter of an hour, but the Ukrainians held on to claim second spot. The Czechs had sat top of the group on eight points, and consolidated top spot when first-half strikes by Pavel Sulc and Adam Hlozek were enough to give them a 2-1 home win over Georgia. In League C, Sweden showcased its striking prowess with a 6-0 thumping of Azerbaijan as it emphatically topped Group C1. Sweden forward Viktor Gyokeres netted four goals to overtake Erling Haaland as the top scorer in the Nations League. Gyokeres started the evening with five goals from five games. His third goal of the night in the 58th minute  scored only a few seconds after the game restarted following another Swedish goal  took the Sporting Lisbon forward to eight goals in six games in this edition of the Nations League, one more than Haaland. Gyokeres  one of the most compelling players in world soccer this season  didn't stop there and added his fourth goal of the game soon after. Haaland had been the top scorer ahead of the final round of games after the Manchester City striker scored seven goals for Norway, including a hat-trick in a 5-0 win over Kazakhstan on Sunday.

49,Drawing on experience,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\26\WS67451254a310f1265a1cf839.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/26/WS67451254a310f1265a1cf839.html,"In the long weeks that separate us from Jan 20, 2025, when Donald Trump takes office, analyses are being fine-tuned in several European capitals, shrouded in bewilderment. And the frequently used phrase is that ""we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands"", already uttered by then German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May 2017, during the time of Trump\'s previous administration. In this context, Spain\'s administration applies resilience and the relationship with China takes on a new dimension. Spanish Minister of Economy, Trade and Enterprise, Carlos Cuerpo, has recently declared that ""Europe has to have its own view and its own position ""distinct from both the United States and China when it comes to trade and tariffs, and that ""Spain has to do its own analysis"", insisting on ""exhausting all possible avenues of negotiation and dialogue"" with China in order to ""reach an acceptable vision for both parties"". The country has the conditions to do so in light of a reading of the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook report published in October, which estimates that the Spanish economy will grow by 2.9 percent in 2024, the highest increase of all the major advanced industrialized countries in the West. The economic growth rate of Spain in 2024 is, overall, more than three times of the economic growth in the euro area. After two visits to China in the past two years by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Madrid sees ""huge potential"" of bilateral cooperation. Some analysts have commented that Spain is opening its doors to China as a trade war between China and Europe looms, which has caused a stir on both sides of the Atlantic. But it is an eloquent summary of the situation as China and Spain enjoy robust economic ties, as shown by the agreements Madrid and Beijing have signed in green development and electric car manufacturing. It should also be noted that Spain was the second-largest automaker in Europe after Germany, and the eighth-largest in the world in 2023. In the first half of this year, almost 60 percent of Spain's electricity came from renewable energy sources, a field in which Spain wants to lead in Europe, according to grid operator Redeia. In September 2024, Chinese wind turbine technologies developer Envision Energy agreed to invest $1 billion to build an industrial park for green hydrogen in Spain, a milestone for the continent. Spain's strategic proximity to China provides access to advanced technology in each of the mentioned fields, thus the agreements are win-win in nature. Concomitantly, Spain wants to highlight to Chinese investors Spain's long-standing cultural and economic ties with other Spanish-speaking countries, in order to serve, in parallel to the Latin American countries' respective bilateral ties with China. This takes on special relevance as during President Xi Jinping's visit to Peru, he inaugurated the megaport of Chancay, the first Pacific logistics center in Latin America. Felipe Gonzalez, the former Spanish prime minister who led Spain\'s transition to democracy from 1982 onwards and is remembered, among other things, for spreading the famous saying by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping ""it doesn\'t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice"", which he learned in Beijing during his official visit in 1985, has called in various fora for correctly interpreting two famous reports to guide the work of the European Commission and the European Council this year, and particularly from next year on, in the light of the current challenges. One is the Letta Report published in April 2024 by Enrico Letta, the former Italian prime minister, empowering the single market to deliver a sustainable future and prosperity for all EU citizens, and the Draghi Report published in September 2024 by Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and former president of the European Central Bank, directing the future of European competitiveness. Today, it is clear from reading both that we must look with fresh eyes at China, one of the world\'s innovative powers, one of Europe\'s most important partners, not see it as a ""systemic rival"", a concept that neither of these documents uses. We know that there may be trade disagreements, but they can be resolved through negotiations. However, in the case of the US, according to all indications, the margin for negotiation will be much smaller and erratic, putting at risk the spirit of bilateralism and the world economic order, and moreover, international stability. The update on the Draghi Report by the Berlin-based think tank MERICS in September is striking. While noting the competitiveness challenges that China presents to the continent, MERICS highlights Draghi's calls for European industrial policies to allocate more resources to key industries and technologies as well as calls for further efforts in education, research, and foreign policies in strategic sectors where green industries, commodities and digital technology are front-runners. The year 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between Spain and China and 50 years of relations between the then European Economic Community (now the EU) and China. These ties, in turn, were preceded at the bilateral level by the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Finland and Sweden in 1950, France in 1964, and Spain in 1973, as well as with other European countries in the 1970s. US-China relations were only established in 1979. It is time to demonstrate Europe's experience and resilience in dealing with Beijing and vice versa. Depending on Trump's attitude to the EU, we might speculate that negotiations between China and the EU on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment or a similar deal, might be back on the agenda.

It is assessed using the China Automobile Customer Satisfaction Index, which attained a score of 81 out of 100 this year. The CAQ has launched the evaluation in China for 23 consecutive years. This year, the association evaluated 160 popular internal combustion models from 36 manufacturers and 44 brands. The survey collected 27,891 valid samples from May 14 to Aug 30, with evaluation criteria based on the five aspects of satisfaction, quality reliability, performance design, after-sales and sales services. The CAQ said that customers perceiving quality beyond expectation and an increase in perceived value were key factors raising the fuel vehicle industry to new heights in satisfaction. Customer perceived quality scored 80.7 points in 2024, up 0.2 of a point from 2023, the third consecutive year it was up and surpassing user expectations for the first time. Perceived value scored 79.5 points, up 1.9 points compared to 2023, reaching its highest in a decade. Satisfaction with domestic brands matched joint venture brands for the first time this year, driven by the perceived value. Domestic brand satisfaction was at 80 points, up one point from 2023. Perceived value for domestic brands was 79.8, leading joint ventures by 0.3 of a point. Loyalty for domestic brands was 77, one point below joint ventures, but the complaint rate was 11 percent, one point higher than joint ventures. German brands demonstrate a clear advantage in satisfaction and loyalty, scoring 81 for satisfaction and 80 in loyalty. Also, the survey finds that first-time buyers favor domestic brands by 36 percent, leading German brands by 9 percentage points. Upgrade and trade-in customers prefer German brands, with Japanese and American buyers also leaning toward them. Service quality improvement was the primary driver of enhanced user perceived quality, the CAQ said. The survey shows after-sales service satisfaction stood at 81 points, a three point increase from 2023. Sales service satisfaction was at 81 points, up by two points from 2023, marking a continuous increase for two years. Regarding vehicle brands, Volvo and Audi topped customer satisfaction in after-sales and sales service respectively among the luxury vehicle brands in the fuel car market, both scoring 83 points. Meanwhile, quality reliability satisfaction was at 78.5 points, a 0.5 point decrease compared to 2023, mainly attributed to the decreased satisfaction in areas of transmission, air conditioning and seating. According to the survey, the number of faults per 100 new cars in the Chinese auto industry was 188 in 2024, an increase of 45 compared to 2023. The three systems with the most faults are the intelligent cockpit, intelligent driving assistance and engine systems, accounting for 56 percent of total faults, compared to 47 percent in 2023. Among the top 10 problems, five belong to the intelligent connected vehicle sector, signaling improved quality in traditional components but a need for better artificial intelligence and connectivity, the CAQ said. Li Gaoshuai, deputy secretary-general of the CAQ, said that the advent of new technologies, exemplified by electric vehicles and intelligent connectivity, poses unprecedented challenges to quality management. The stability and safety of components such as batteries and motors directly influence overall vehicle quality reliability. This requires a thorough reevaluation of quality management systems across all stages of automotive production, with the potential establishment of new quality control models in key areas to meet the higher demands of modern technology, said Li. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said there will still be considerable development opportunities for fuel vehicles globally. It is also essential for vehicle manufacturers to focus on sustainable development efforts while advancing new energy vehicles. Cui also called for equal policy support for fuel vehicles and NEVs, to promote a fair market share for fuel vehicles, ensuring fair competition and providing consumers an equal choice.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/28/671ef408a310f1268d83a0dd.jpeg'],['Volvo showcases two of its sedans at the 2024 Chengdu International Motor Show in August.[CAO YINGYING/CHINA DAILY]'],2024-10-28 09:10,CAO YINGYING,"- **Main Topics:**

""I just looked up and the bar was still there,"" the Swede laughed. Duplantis and Ethiopia distance runner Gudaf Tsegay both set new world records on Sunday to wrap up the season at the Prefontaine Classic track and field meet. Known as Mondo, Duplantis leaped 6.23 meters. The reigning world champion broke his own record of 6.22 meters set indoors earlier this year. He was swarmed by fellow competitors after clearing the jump before hopping onto the track's railing and striking a victory pose for fans at Eugene's Hayward Field. ""We\'re not only competitors, but we really are brothers and we have a great time together out there,"" Duplantis said. ""To see them embrace me like that after doing a jump, breaking a world record, I\'m thankful. I just feel very thankful."" He has now reset the world record seven times. Five of those marks were set indoors, with both of his outdoor world marks coming at Hayward Field in Eugene, where he won the world title last year. ""I\'m two for two right now on world records coming here to Hayward,"" Duplantis said. ""It has absolutely everything. It has the history, it has the modern touch. The track is really fast, the crowd and energy is fantastic."" Duplantis retained his world title in Budapest last month with a clearance of 6.10m and cleared 6.12 in Ostrava in June. He failed in a string of attempts at 6.23 since February, including at Brussels earlier this month, but said the smaller field in the finals was more conducive to a record attempt. ""I think that it\'s a lot easier to be fresh at that world record height,"" he said. Duplantis had already secured victory with a height of 6.02  the 73rd clearance of his career of more than six meters. In his first effort at 6.23, with the crowd chanting, he raced up the runway and sailed over. ""I just try to jump high,"" said Duplantis, who believes he can continue to improve the record. ""The limit is very high, and I hope that I can continue to jump well and keep jumping higher than I did today."" Earlier in the day, Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay broke the world record in the women's 5,000 meters, finishing in 14:00.21. Tsegay bested the record of 14:05.20 set by Kenya's Faith Kipyegon earlier this year in Paris. Tsegay's finish was nearly 12 seconds better than her personal best. Kenyan Beatrice Chebet was runner-up in 14:05.92. Afterward, the 26-year-old Tsegay vowed to try to go under 14 minutes next year: ""Yes, I try,"" she said. The Prefontaine Classic, normally run in late May, was this year's final stop on the international Diamond League circuit. The 32 champions crowned during the two-day meet earned $30,000 apiece. It was the last major international track and field competition before the athletes begin gearing up for the Paris Olympics next summer. Canadian Andre De Grasse, the 200m champion at the Tokyo Olympics, won the event Sunday in 19.76 seconds to cap his season. Shericka Jackson couldn't break Florence Griffith-Joyner's 35-yearold 200m world record, but the Jamaican's 21.57 was enough to complete a sprint double after her 100m victory on Saturday. Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen followed up his sensational win in the mile on Saturday with victory in the 3,000m. In a photo finish with Ethiopia's Yomif Kejelcha, Ingebrigtsen crossed the line first in 7:23.63. American Joe Kovacs had a monster throw of 22.93m in the men's shot put, ahead of native Oregonian and world-record holder Ryan Crouser. Crouser was diagnosed with blood clots in his left leg just before winning the shot put at the world championships last month in Budapest. He's been on medication to shrink the clots. ""Super happy with the season. Had a lot of adversity this year that really wasn\'t planned  not that it ever is,"" Crouser said.

Duplantis, 23, cleared the heights six times all with only one attempt, winning the gold in 6.10m. He did try to improve his own world record of 6.22m by 1cm but missed it after three jumps. Ernest John Obiena from the Philippines finished second in 6.00m, one place higher than he achieved at last year's World Championships while Australian Kurtis Marschall and American Christopher Nilsen both followed behind in 5.95m. ""I felt a bit of pressure as defending champion, but I\'m glad to come through it. It feels pretty good to be on top again,"" said Duplantis. After Duplantis' triumph, Lyles enjoyed the stage light as the American did a sensational fourth-legged run in the men's 4x100m relay final to claim his third title in the tournament. On Saturday, Lyles took his third straight world title in the 200m event to become the first man to make the 100m and 200m doubles at the World Championships since Jamaican legend Usain Bolt achieved it in 2015. ""This is the third gold for me here. It\'s sensational, amazing. You can\'t do better,"" said Lyles after the US men\'s team won in this year\'s leading time of 37.38 seconds.

54,EU tariffs on Chinese EVs raise trade war concerns,"('Sweden', 'Swedish')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202409\18\WS66ea9455a3103711928a87bf.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/18/WS66ea9455a3103711928a87bf.html,"FRANKFURT - The EU has ignored fresh proposals from Chinese automakers aimed at resolving the dispute over Chinese EVs in the European market, undermining efforts to ease tensions through dialogue. The decision to impose tariffs on China-made EVs, despite several offers from Chinese manufacturers, has sparked a new wave of outcry within the bloc. Growing opposition Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, during a recent visit to China, voiced his opposition to the proposed EU tariffs on Chinese EVs, urging the EU to reconsider and seek a compromise with China to avoid a trade war. His concerns were echoed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also criticized the tariff plan. In May, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned against levying tariffs on Chinese EVs, saying that ""a wider trade war where we block each other\'s products is not the way to go for industrial nations such as Germany and Sweden."" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban described the tariffs as a ""brutal"" punishment against Chinese automakers and called for open competition. These dissenting voices suggest that the decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs lacks unanimous support among all EU member states. ""Many believe that this is a step towards a trade war between Europe and China, which will ultimately harm the European economy,"" said Croatian political analyst Mladen Plese. German automotive expert Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Bochum, said that such a protectionist approach might push EU automakers to increase investments in China, the world's largest car market and a leader in the rapidly growing EV industry. He warned that protectionism and tariffs are misguided strategies and would result in losses for Germany and the EU. ""The European Commission\'s punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products. Cars become cheaper through more competition, open markets, and significantly better business conditions in the EU, not through trade war and market isolation,"" said German Transport Minister Volker Wissing in a message posted on X. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store openly opposed punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs. In a recent interview with Chinese media, he emphasized that as a non-EU member, Norway is not bound by EU policies. ""Consumers in Norway should have access to the cars they want to buy,"" he stated. Impact on automakers, consumers The EU's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs, intended to protect the bloc's auto industry, may instead stifle growth and restrict European consumers' access to more affordable Chinese EV models, analysts said. Germany's auto industry has long thrived in an open market. However, these tariffs are expected to drive up prices, reducing competitive pressure on European automakers to develop more affordable EV models, which are currently in limited supply. ""The European manufacturers do need to be challenged,"" noted Rico Luman, a senior economist at ING focusing on transport, logistics, and the automotive industry. Chinese EV makers have gained a competitive edge in the global market through rapid production growth, advanced technology, and cutting-edge innovations, noted Luman. Sjors ten Tije, manager of the Dutch Association of Electric Drivers, said that European manufacturers rely heavily on Chinese parts and additional tariffs would hamper Europe's automotive development. Higher tariffs will result in higher EV prices, making it harder for consumers seeking clean transportation to find affordable models, he added. ""The transition to electric driving may be delayed. This could ultimately lead to less available funds for research and development,"" said Maarten Steinbuch, professor in Systems and Control at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Slowing down green transformation Experts warn that in addition to disrupting trade and collaboration between the EU and China, the tariffs on Chinese EVs could jeopardize the EU's planned transition to a greener economy. Piotr Gadzinowski, former editor-in-chief of the Polish newspaper Trybuna, emphasized that cooperation with China in the EV industry is crucial for the EU to meet its climate goals. Gadzinowski noted that tariffs on Chinese EVs would impede the promotion of electric vehicles in the EU, especially in countries with low EV adoption. Supply chain disruptions and the breakdown of collaborative research efforts could negatively impact both European and Chinese manufacturers, further straining EU-China relations, he said. Eric De Keuleneer, executive director of the Brussels-based University Foundation and Emeritus Professor at the ULB Solvay Brussels School, urged EU policymakers to consider the tariffs' impact on Europe's green transition and industrial development, emphasizing the importance of Chinese support in providing affordable batteries, which would benefit both European consumers and automakers. Dick Roche, former Irish minister for European affairs, questioned the logic of imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs, given the EU\'s green transition goals. ""Technological change will be a key driver of the green and digital transition in Europe. Like it or not, China happens to be a leader in technologies vital for Europe\'s progress towards carbon neutrality,"" he said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202409/18/66ea9455a3103711c3487c43.jpeg'],"['China-made new energy vehicles await shipment to Europe in Xiamen, Fujian province.

The exhibition, Chapas Sinicas－Stories of Macao in Torre do Tombo, features more than 100 facsimiles of documents taken from a collection at the Portuguese national archive, titled the Official Records of Macao During the Qing Dynasty (1693-1886). Housed in Lisbon, the collection comprises more than 3,600 documents and includes many official Chinese records and their Portuguese translations, plus other unofficial documents. As well as diplomatic and public affairs, the archive offers a deep insight into Macanese society during the 18th and 19th centuries, touching on everything from daily life and social customs to urban construction, and trade and commerce. Macao's significance as a key hub for China's external trade and interaction, and its pivotal role at the intersection of East and West, is apparent in the every aspect of the documents. Known as the Chapas Sinicas (Chinese documents), the collection－which was named after the stamp that was placed on official correspondences－was jointly nominated by the National Archive of Torre do Tombo and the Archives of Macao before being successfully inscribed by UNESCO onto the Memory of the World Register in 2017. The exhibition is an important component of a yearlong cultural festival held in both countries to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Portugal, according to Luo Shugang, China's minister of culture and tourism. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of Macao's return to China. Exchanges between China and Portugal via the Maritime Silk Road date back to the 16th century. During the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties, Macao was a trading port where Chinese and foreign ships anchored down the coast from Guangzhou. The port, which used to be called Hao Jing Ao, was affiliated with Xiangshan county in Guangzhou prefecture and was a key center for shipping and trade with countries like Britain, France, Russia, the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. The Portuguese were permitted to stay in Macao from around the mid-16th century onward, but China maintained full sovereignty over the settlement by appointing officials and implementing laws and issuing decrees until 1849.",['http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201906/18/5d0836eda3103dbf57a4fd3e.jpeg'],"[""The exhibition at Beijing's National Library of China, Chapas Sinicas－Stories of Macao in Torre do Tombo, features more than 100 facsimiles of documents taken from a collection at the Portuguese national archive.\xa0[Photo by FANG AIQING/CHINA DAILY]""]",2019-06-18 08:57,FANG AIQING,"- **Main Topics:**

The recent veto of California Senate Bill 1047 by Governor Gavin Newsom on Sept 29 has reignited discussions about the balance between innovation and regulation in the AI industry. The bill, which aimed to hold large AI model developers responsible for potential ""catastrophic"" harm caused by their models, was rejected due to concerns that it might jeopardize California\'s leadership in AI development. Despite the veto, discussions continue over how to best govern this technology. Experts interviewed by China Daily emphasized the importance of finding a balanced approach through international collaboration and information sharing. ""Whenever technology advances, there\'s always the misapplication of technology. And the best disinfectant is openness and sharing,"" Randy Schekman, professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a 2013 Nobel Laureate, told China Daily. He said that access to information about global AI activities is crucial for identifying potential misuse and also highlighted the need for societal controls on advanced technologies like AI. ""Scientists can\'t make all the decisions. These decisions have to be made by society, and there has to be some way of controlling the misapplication of technology through societal intervention,"" he said. ""We live in a diverse world and there are different standards. There needs to be international cooperation on standards for the misapplication of any new technology."" Kai-Fu Lee, chairman and CEO of Sinovation Ventures and author of AI 2041 and the New York Times bestseller AI Superpowers, echoed concerns about the potential dangers of AI. He pointed out generative AI's capabilities, such as planning wars, designing weapons or autonomously deciding to kill, and advocated for international collaboration on threats like autonomous weapons. ""These larger issues ... will require countries to sit down together to work on them,"" he said. Lee suggested that the US and China, along with other nations, should prioritize tackling common threats and sharing technological developments to ensure AI safety. ""I think the countries will see that as a common interest, and they may have the motivation to work together,"" he added. A new study by Florence G'sell, a visiting professor at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center, compared the AI governance approaches of China, the United States and the European Union. The study highlighted the United States and China as ""the clear front-runners"" in AI development, with data from the Stanford AI Index Report 2024 showing that 61 AI models were developed by US-based institutions in 2023, while 21 were developed in the European Union and 15 in China. The author noted that China is one of the leading nations with the most extensive AI legislation, particularly concerning generative AI. The country's Global AI Governance Initiative makes a commitment to developing ethical norms, privacy protections and legal structures. It also emphasizes international collaboration and equitable governance of AI technologies. China has also introduced measures for scientific and technological ethics reviews, signaling its dedication to ""enforcing its ethical standards in science and technology, and safeguarding societal welfare against the backdrop of rapid technological advancement"", said the study. Unlike the European Union or China, the United States lacks a comprehensive federal framework for AI governance. Instead, it relies on voluntary commitments from major AI companies. The study suggests that there does not appear to be much appetite in the US to ameliorate AI risks with a new federal agency or sweeping new rules, with most proposed legislation revealing a reluctance to overregulate or stifle innovation. Despite geopolitical tensions, experts argue that the US and China have the responsibility to ensure the ethical use of AI technologies and the two countries can learn from each other's practices to lead global AI governance. ""AI is having a transformative impact on every aspect of life in modern society, so it\'s very important for us to think very carefully how to inform the policymakers and the lawmakers to regulate and help to guide the development and usage of AI to ensure that it is ethical and responsible and will help improve life for all people in our global society,"" said Tsu-Jae King Liu, dean of the College of Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. ""Today, the US and China have the leading technologies on AI so I think it\'s very important for us to be able to collaborate and together chart a path for a safe and secure future that will be healthy and beneficial for all,"" she added. Yangqing Jia, founder and CEO of Silicon Valley-based Lepton AI and a former AI expert with Alibaba, pointed out similarities between the US and China, describing both as ""pro-development"" with a vivid venture capital industry in terms of technology. He sees the potential for more frequent technological collaborations between the two countries and emphasizes the need for a collaborative environment in a rapidly changing world. ""We\'re both building great technologies, not only AI, but also cloud and other software that are open source and shared with the world,"" said Jia. ""As someone who has studied in the US and worked in both China and the US, I\'ve seen that there are many opportunities for technological collaboration between the two countries.

Lv Wei, a 31-year-old violinist, is the assistant principal of the Wuxi Symphony Orchestra in East China\'s Jiangsu province. Her musical journey began because her parents  as she put it  ""forced"" her into it. ""My parents believed that playing an instrument would help me focus better on my studies at school, so they introduced me to the piano first and later to the violin,"" Lv said. ""After a few years of practice, I developed a fondness for the sound of the violin and wanted to share my music and ideas with different people on stage."" For Benjamin Essomba, a 26-year-old music producer from Cameroon, his love for music developed more naturally. Growing up attending church, he had early access to various instruments. ""I don\'t recall ever being forced to play music,"" said Essomba. ""When you see people you know and love playing something that sounds really good, you\'ll think, \'Why can\'t I do it?\'"" However, loving music and mastering it are two different endeavors. Ludoviko Maletti, a 25-year-old French horn player from Italy currently performing with the Wuxi Symphony Orchestra, believes that many talented musicians have been immersed in music from a very young age, often being the offspring of musicians themselves. ""Talent does exist, but it\'s a product of nurturing rather than nature,"" Maletti explained, adding that he personally doesn\'t believe he has inherent talent; rather, everything he has achieved is a result of dedicated cultivation. Lv believes that 75 percent effort and 25 percent talent are the crucial ingredients for creating a great musician. ""We need a lot of time and attention to practice the techniques, and then the 25 percent of talent can elevate you to a higher level as an artist,"" she said. While becoming a recognized musician is challenging, some may argue that developing an appreciation for classical music, such as symphonies, can also be difficult and requires a refined taste. Maletti suggested that those interested in exploring classical music can begin with more accessible pieces, such as the rhythmic first movement of The Rite of Spring by Russian-born composer Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971). ""Back in high school, I added this piece to my friend\'s playlist, and he ended up enjoying it. He later expressed that he was up for more classical music,"" Maletti said. Chen Shihua, a 19-year-old student from Peking University, pointed out the potential of movie soundtracks to foster an interest in classical music among the public. ""For example, Playing Love from The Legend of 1900 is one of my favorite pieces in movies. I can feel a mixture of regret, love, humanity, memories, and a myriad of complex emotions in it,"" said Chen. As musicians grow and refine their skills, they often seek collaborations across different styles, genres, and countries. Melissa Baidak, a 24-year-old doctoral student from Russia at Beijing Foreign Studies University, shared her experience attending a concert featuring a fusion of Western and Chinese musical instruments, such as the violin and the pipa (a four-stringed Chinese lute). ""Music serves as a tool for intercultural communication, bringing people together and making the sound of different musical instruments more fascinating,"" said Baidak. Wang Zongnan, a 24-year-old student from Tsinghua University, also witnessed a harmonious blend of performance styles across countries. Recalling an event hosted by China\'s Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra and the Spanish theater group La Fura, he described it as a ""visual symphony"". ""The orchestra played Beethoven\'s Pastoral Symphony in the center of the stage, while La Fura\'s actors performed a play at the front of the stage and among the audience. The play revolved around environmental protection. It was a magical combination of cultures,"" he said. The host of this episode of Youth Power , 19-year-old Wang Licheng, a student at Peking University, emphasized that music itself is a universal language that transcends borders to unite different peoples and nurture mutual understanding. Wang Zongnan agreed, underlining the practical aspect of self-expression. He shared how his exchange experience in Sweden led him to write a song whimsically reflecting on the evolution of his own cultural identity, as he explored both the similarities and differences among various cultures. Dylan Walker, 27, a music enthusiast from the United States, also resonates with Wang Licheng's belief in the power of music to foster understanding. Having studied and lived in China for years, Walker has formed friendships not only with Chinese locals but also with people from diverse backgrounds worldwide. ""Singing together in Chinese is one thing, but singing a song in their native language with them creates a deep emotional connection. It really brings you closer together and helps you understand their culture. It also sparks an interest in understanding each other and a sense of mutual respect,"" said Walker. Joseph Chen, 26, a trombone player in the Wuxi Symphony Orchestra, sees music as more than just a means of self-expression and building friendships. He believes it's a core aspect of human existence. Chen referenced Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which suggests that as humans, our most inherent necessities start from food and shelter, with art being a higher-level need. However, he observes that the actual progression of human development is quite the opposite: before we had shelter and a stable source of food, we had cave paintings and bone flutes, which were art and music. ""Creating art is more fundamental to being human than having enough to eat. So, what we musicians do here is profoundly essential to the human experience. It\'s something that\'s very ingrained in what it means to be human,"" Chen said.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202404/03/660c9656a31082fc2b6b9521.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202404/03/660c9656a31082fc2b6b9523.png']","['In the latest episode of Youth Power, young music enthusiasts and musicians from different backgrounds share their stories about how they believe music shapes the world.\xa0[Photo by DONG MING/FOR CHINA DAILY]', 'Online Watch the video by scanning the code.']",2024-04-03 07:35,LI XINRAN,"- **Main Topics:**

These pulsars include a large number of millisecond pulsars and pulsar binaries, enriching the diversity and quantity of known pulsars, which is of great significance for understanding the formation and evolution of pulsars, said Zhu Weiwei, chief scientist at the FAST Operation and Development Center. Pulsars are the remnants of massive stars that have died. Due to their high density, rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields, they are considered ""natural laboratories"" for studying many frontier astronomical issues. The discovery of the first pulsar in 1967 proved the existence of neutron stars, earning a Nobel Prize in 1974. The discovery of the binary pulsar in 1974 provided indirect evidence of the existence of gravitational wave radiation, winning the Nobel Prize in 1993. ""Observing pulsars allows us to test general relativity, detect low-frequency gravitational waves and provide crucial data for theoretical research in pulsar physics,"" Zhu said. FAST made its first pulsar discovery in 2017. Since its official opening in 2020, the telescope has averaged more than 5,000 hours of observation time per year. Since 2021, it has been open to international applications, with about half its observation time allocated to open projects, Zhu said. A team led by NAOC researcher Han Jinlin has been conducting a pulsar survey of the Galactic plane since 2020, discovering over 750 pulsars to date. Han said that the team's discoveries have provided key evidence of faint pulsars in the Milky Way. The millisecond pulsars and pulsar binaries found in the Galactic star field offer new insight for understanding the still-debated evolutionary pathways of binary stars and serve as excellent probes for monitoring gravitational waves. ""The FAST discoveries include many of the weakest and lowest luminosity pulsars known, giving new information about the low end of the pulsar radio luminosity function,"" said Dick Manchester, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. Xu Renxin, a professor at Peking University, believes that scientific research related to pulsars perfectly embodies the fundamental principles of quantum theory and relativity. The construction of the world's largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, the China Sky Eye, has ushered in a new era of radio astronomy research. Dai Zigao, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, said that there are still many key issues in the field of pulsar research that remain unresolved. The China Sky Eye is aimed at observing and studying these critical issues. ""In the future, the China Sky Eye will explore ways to enhance spatial resolution and play an important role in more areas such as fast radio bursts. It is expected to make more significant achievements, such as eventually detecting nanohertz gravitational wave signals, revealing the origins of fast radio bursts and discovering black hole-neutron star binaries,"" he said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/27/67466d45a310f1268d85aca5.jpeg'],"['A panoramic photo of China\'s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world\'s largest filled-aperture and most sensitive radio telescope, is taken on Sept 25, 2024.

""I do feel quite tired after these Olympics, so I need a good rest,"" said the 27-year-old Chinese paddler in a recent interview. ""Right now, I\'m not thinking about the next Olympics. As for the future, let\'s entrust it to time,"" he added. Fan dispatched Truls Moregard of Sweden 4-1 to capture the men\'s singles title in Paris, becoming the 11th player overall to have achieved a career ""Grand Slam""  winning titles at the Olympic Games, World Championships and World Cup  before teaming up with Ma Long and Wang Chuqin to pocket the team gold. But, his journey to the top step of the podium was not smooth sailing. In the quarterfinals, he was 0-2 down against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto, and it would have proved costly for team China if Fan were eliminated, as top seed Wang Chuqin had already crashed out in the round of 32. ""That match put me under the most pressure I\'ve felt at an Olympics. If I had lost, many records, or the past glory of the Chinese team, would have slipped from my hands,"" he recalled. During a short break, Fan, accompanied by his coach Wang Hao, changed into a fresh shirt before returning to the court. ""It helped adjust my tempo. Before the match, I told my coach that I had prepared three shirts, and we would change one if I felt the match was going the wrong way,"" Fan reflected. ""It might be a tiny adjustment, but I wanted to make it to see if there was any chance of changing the game."" Fan managed to achieve a superb comeback win over the full seven games to advance to the last four. ""Although it was just a quarterfinal, and I was not sure about winning the title, at the time I felt that I had achieved success and that I had won a battle with myself."" Ahead of his golden glory at the Paris Olympics, Fan hit a low ebb, losing in several World Table Tennis (WTT) tournaments and the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) World Cup. ""Nothing is impossible until the final point is played. I finished second place in almost every competition in the past, but for me, the runner-up is also a treasure,"" Fan said. Since the opening of the Paris Olympics, Chinese authorities have ramped up their efforts to crack down on the overzealous behavior of ""fan circles"" in sports. The Chinese Table Tennis Association (CTTA) recently issued a statement, expressing its firm support for the authorities\' efforts. Fan, who has been impacted by the fan circle culture himself, echoed the CTTA, saying: ""I hope to grab the limelight on the court, but I don\'t want to be in the spotlight off it. That should be normal for an athlete. But, now, you will find some things off the field have been amplified and given excessive attention, which brings about too much pressure and makes you uncomfortable."" ""I have experienced some things. Sometimes you feel that you cannot lose (for fear of online abuse), but, sometimes, if you win, it can also be bad. It will only do harm to myself, to table tennis, and to the unity of the whole team,"" he added. Online clampdown The Chinese government and sporting bodies have condemned fans for using social media to attack and spread rumors about the country's Olympians, and said the behavior had an extremely negative impact on athletes, coaches and their families. The Ministry of Public Security said it would crack down on ""illegal and criminal acts of \'fan circles\' as part of its internet security measures"" and urged people not to ""spread rumors, nor attack or slander others"". It highlighted four cases where it had taken action against fan groups for their treatment of athletes who competed at the Paris Olympics, including some fans who had ""insulted and defamed table tennis players and coaches"". CTTA said the ""chaos"" of fan groups had interfered with the team\'s training and competition. The public security ministry said that another case centered around gymnasts being insulted on social media. At the weekend, the Chinese Gymnastics Association said athletes, coaches and managers had been the targets of rumors and insults, negatively impacting their work, lives and families. The statements came after swimmer Pan Zhanle, 20, who broke the world record in the 100m freestyle, disbanded his only fan group page on social medial platform Weibo and told state broadcaster CCTV that he preferred to keep a low profile.  ""A bad thing about being famous is that too many people surround me,"" he said. ""Honestly, I wouldn\'t mind if my performance had been less exceptional, if it meant I could return to training in peace."" China delivered its best performance at a Summer Olympics since the 2008 Beijing Games on home soil, tying with the United States for the most gold medals won at Paris 2024. The delegation's 40 golds were an all-time high for a Games held outside China, and were achieved despite immense pressure and heightened scrutiny resulting from a doping row involving some of its swimmers.

The newly added tariffs, which are already in place and will be valid for five years, stand at 7.8 percent for Tesla, 18.8 percent for Geely, and 35.3 percent for SAIC Motor, in addition to the EU's existing 10 percent duty on imported cars. Other Chinese EV makers face an average tariff of 20.7 percent, with rates reaching up to 35.3 percent for those classified as ""non-cooperative"". The decision, announced on Tuesday, came after a months-long EU investigation, claiming EVs made in China are receiving unfair State subsidies. The Chinese government and carmakers have repeatedly said that the allegations are ""groundless"". In a statement on Wednesday, SAIC Motor expressed disappointment and said that it plans to pursue necessary legal action by filing a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the European Union to ensure its legitimate rights and interests. The Chinese automaker said that it is introducing vehicles of different powertrains to Europe as part of its efforts to strengthen its resilience against the EU's trade barriers. Also, SAIC and Geely have accused the European Commission of lying. In a 287-page document, the commission, which is the executive arm of the EU, said it had conducted separate negotiations with SAIC and Geely's subsidiaries, including Volvo and smart, before the decision was announced. Geely said on Thursday it had ""never"" conducted separate negotiations with the commission regarding electric vehicle tariffs, although it was approached. In a statement posted on social media platform Weibo, Geely said that the commission sought direct contact with its brands during the negotiation period from late September to mid-October, and it ""prioritized industry unity and declined separate discussions"". ""Geely remains committed to supporting the industry-wide negotiations, contributing actively to protect the overall interests of the sector,"" the company said. China\'s SAIC Motor refuted reports about separate negotiations with the EU on the matter as well. The reports ""seriously deviate from the facts"" and are purely rumors, said the company. Following the announcement of the EU\'s decision, BMW Group said the move ""not only restricts global free trade, but also fuels the danger of a far-reaching trade conflict from which no one gains"". It said the punitive tariffs harm the business model of globally operating companies, including BMW, and limit the supply of electric vehicles for European customers. ""It is therefore all the more urgent that the EU and China  as key drivers of sustainable mobility  continue their negotiations to find a viable solution as quickly as possible,"" said BMW. The Chinese government has repeatedly criticized the EU over the investigation and tariff rises, arguing its actions violate international trade rules and threaten global progress on fighting climate change. In a statement on Wednesday, the Ministry of Commerce said Beijing would ""continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies"". It added that it hoped Brussels could work with Beijing in a ""constructive manner"" to resolve the dispute through dialogue. The ministry reiterated China's stance on Thursday, saying that it has consistently supported and encouraged mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation between the Chinese and European automotive industries. China has continuously maintained an open and collaborative stance, promoting a market-driven approach and encouraging healthy competition, said He Yadong, the ministry's spokesman at a weekly briefing. The EV tariffs have caused deep divisions in the EU as well, with strong opposition from member states including Germany and Hungary. German carmakers, including BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have heavily criticized the EU measures. However, France's PFA car association has welcomed duties. A spokesman for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday that Berlin was pushing for a negotiated solution. ""Such trade conflicts are not something we should strive for and in this respect the clear expectation toward Brussels, but also toward Beijing, is that good results will be achieved in the ongoing talks so that a trade conflict can be averted,"" he said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the EU was headed for an ""economic cold war"" with China.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/04/67282408a310f1268d841d9c.jpeg'],['The SAIC Anji cargo ship docks close to lines of vehicles in Shandong province in May.\xa0TANG KE/FOR CHINA DAILY'],2024-11-04 09:31,LI FUSHENG,"- **Main Topics:**

""Together with Chinese customers and partners, we have developed many energy infrastructure projects, continuously invested and expanded our manufacturing capacity in China, in order to meet the growing market demand in China and across the world,"" he said. Pledging to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, China has been steadfast in accelerating its energy transition. Over the past decade, the share of clean energy in the country's total energy use has increased 10.9 percentage points, according to the National Energy Administration. Dedicated to promoting clean energy in China, Siemens Energy has established 15 manufacturing facilities across the country. It has become an important partner in the country's energy transition, Bruch said. At this year's CIIE, the company is poised to showcase its cutting-edge decarbonization technologies for the energy sector. Many of its exhibits will be presented for the first time in Asia or China. ""During the expo, I look forward to meeting and exchanging ideas with partners, building consensus and fostering collaborative development,"" Bruch said. ""Tackling climate change and driving energy transition is a daunting task that no single country or region can accomplish alone."" Bruch's emphasis on collaboration aligns with China's increasing global contributions. According to a white paper issued by China's State Council Information Office in August this year, the country's wind power and photovoltaic exports helped other countries reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by about 810 million tons in 2023. Recognizing China\'s role in the global energy transition, Bruch highlighted Siemens Energy\'s confidence in deepening cooperation with its Chinese partners. ""We are fully committed to working together to build a new energy ecosystem that supports China\'s dual-carbon goals and fosters sustainable energy development worldwide.""",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/05/6729ac9ba310f1268d843db7.jpeg'],"['This photo taken on Nov 4, 2024 shows the automobile exhibition area of the 7th China International Import Expo (CIIE) at the National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai) in Shanghai.

72,Google to pay $1 billion in France to settle fiscal fraud probe,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\201909\12\WS5d7a690fa310cf3e3556b525.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201909/12/WS5d7a690fa310cf3e3556b525.html," Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago in a deal that may create a legal precedent for other large tech companies present in the country. French investigators have been seeking to establish whether Google, whose European headquarters are based in Dublin, failed to pay its dues to the state by avoiding to declare parts of its activities in the country. The settlement comprises a fine of 500 million euros and additional taxes of 465 million euros, Google said in a statement. Google, part of Alphabet Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts. ""(The agreement allows) to settle once for all these past disputes,"" said Antonin Levy, one of Google\'s lawyers, at a hearing in the Paris court. The combined tax payment is less than the 1.6 billion euros the finance ministry had been seeking from Google after the company's Paris offices were raided in 2016. At the time, the ministry had ruled out settling with the company. Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin told Le Figaro newspaper on Thursday the settlement would create a legal precedent and added that talks were underway with several other companies, big and small. He did not specify their names. European countries have struggled to tax the profits of multinational tech companies derived in their jurisdictions. France has pushed hard for a digital tax to cover European Union member states, but ran up against resistance from Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The French government has eventually imposed its own unilateral tax, prompting US President Donald Trump to brandish the menace of a retaliatory tax on French wine. ""We remain convinced that a coordinated reform of the international tax system is the best way to provide a clear framework for companies operating worldwide,"" Google said.

This is the third consecutive year that the awardees in this category are associated with genetics. The 2023 prize had gone to Katalin Karik and Drew Weissman for their research in ""nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19"", while the 2022 award went to Svante Pbo for his discoveries concerning ""the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution"", which was based on modern DNA technologies. It all began way back in 1944 when Oswald Avery found that DNA is the bearer of an organism's genetic code, which was elaborated upon later on by James Watson and Francis Crick, who showed the DNA molecule has a long double helix structure and the RNA molecule a long single helix structure, which are like encryptions with which mankind can influence the traits of new lives. That opened up the possibility of tweaking genes in order to get better vegetables, fruits and cattle species in a way much more efficient than in the past when people had no choice but to wait for generations of them to improve. More importantly, with the human genome map finished drawing and releases in 2003, scientists have been developing drugs and coming up with treatments for diseases based on genetic studies. Unlike editing human embryo genes which is illegal, studies show the possibility of curing diseases by tweaking DNA. CRISPR/Cas9, a tool that is also called ""genetic scissors"", is being used to treat cancer by removing genes or correcting mutations. CAR T-cell Therapy, an emerging immunotherapy that has proven effective in fighting blood cancer in some patients in 2021, also involves gene technologies. Ambros and Ruvkun's discovery of microRNA and its crucial role in genetic regulation will definitely lead to greater breakthroughs in medical science, bringing hope to more patients suffering from diseases that are considered fatal today. There was a saying that the 21st century is a century of life science and the flourishing gene science is proving that.

They said countries should work together to strengthen cooperation and multilateralism to deal with challenges and uncertainties jointly, in a bid to foster a more balanced and sustainable growth for the world's future. Nobel Prize-winning economist Michael Spence highlighted that the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges from climate change, rising geopolitical tensions as well as headwinds from declining productivity growth and aging issues. ""China has made enormous progress in electric vehicles, solar battery technology and so on,"" Spence said during the meeting on Saturday via a video link. ""These need to spread around the world and be made available everywhere So if we use these tools wisely, we have a reasonable chance of not only overcoming the current headwinds to growth and development in many parts of the world but also putting the global economy on a different trajectory."" Citing a recent report by Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics, the university's President Zhao Zhongxiu called on Global South countries to participate in the global value chain and promote green and low-carbon development, adding that China's experiences are helpful for those countries in dealing with the challenges ahead. ""China has been a member of the World Trade Organization for over 20 years, which offers valuable insights, particularly in cooperation with Global South countries,"" Zhao said. ""From China\'s perspective, the key takeaway is to leverage multilateral and bilateral trade agreements to promote economic development."" When it comes to green and low-carbon development, he said that presents an opportunity for Global South countries to catch up, particularly in the area of energy transition. ""The key is strengthening policy coordination and multilateral cooperation,"" Zhao said. ""It is essential to encourage green technological innovation and application, as well as to advance technology transfer and cooperation, rather than imposing technological blockades."" Jin Xu, chairman of the China Association of International Trade, noted that the current global political and economic landscape faces many uncertainties, saying a decoupling of Western countries and China would lead to significant losses for both sides and erode global confidence in future economic development.

As the No 1 and No 2 players, respectively, on the China Tour Order of Merit, teenagers Li Linqiang and Liu Enhua have taken the domestic circuit by storm and are dreaming of accomplishing even bigger feats on the global stage. The 19-year-old Li has dominated the China Tour this season with three wins, while the 17-year-old Liu has one title to his name. Both are aiming to be atop the leaderboard when the Mitsubishi Electric FA Golf Open concludes on Sunday at Suzhou Taihu International Golf Club. For Li, who this year has triumphed at the Jinan Open, Guotai Cup Match Play and the Guotai Open, the motivation to win this week in Jiangsu province has special meaning. "" (PGA Tour regular) Dou Zecheng has always been my role model. I read that he is the only player to win four times on the China Tour. I want to follow in his footsteps and also win four times. Hopefully I can do it on Sunday,"" he said. Both Li and Liu grew up in Haikou, Hainan's capital situated in the north of the island, and took different paths to the pro game. While Liu was a child prodigy, training and competing regularly from the age of 6, Li didn't pick up a golf club until he was 9. With his parents originally hailing from Harbin in the northern, often-frozen Heilongjiang province, neither played golf. His father's brother, however, did and introduced the young Li to the sport on a sun-drenched island that boasts more than 20 golf clubs, including the Mission Hills Haikou complex where 10 courses surround the massive resort. ""My first coach was Sun Xiuhua, one of the first-generation lady professionals in China. Then I followed a Spanish coach,"" said Li. ""Golf was a relatively late interest for me in contrast to my counterparts, but I immediately fell in love with the game and took it seriously."" His dedication quickly paid off. In 2017, Li made the cut at the Hainan Open as a 13-year-old to become the youngest player to do so on the European Challenge Tour  which co-sanctioned the event. Li turned pro in 2022 after winning the China Tour Qualifying Tournament, and soon came close to collecting his first title, losing a playoff to Ma Chengyao at the Hengdian Championship. ""I thought I was close to the win, I have the game to win. It inspired me,"" said Li, whose current world ranking is No 1,424. ""I managed to get my first win at Shandong Guyun Lake Golf Course (at the Jinan Open). Going into the final round, I was three shots behind. Chen Guxin was the leader. He played solidly, but the wind picked up late in the final round, and while Chen struggled down the stretch, I grasped the chance."" Having pocketed 351,168 yuan ($48,015) in prize money so far this year, Li sits comfortably atop the order of merit, and cannot be overtaken this week with the winner's purse of 90,000 yuan. But with four tournaments left in the season after this week, several players are looking to overtake him in the run-up to the season-ending CGC Championship. The money-list winner this year automatically receives a full-playing card for next season on the DP World Tour, formerly known as the European Tour. Liu, second on the money list with 230,253 yuan, is among those gunning for the title. The teenager got his first taste of glory on the circuit in May when he won the Exciting Hangzhou West Lake Open, beating Chen Guixin by one stroke. He then finished runner-up to Li at the Guotai Cup Men's and Women's Professional Match Play in August. ""My plan didn\'t change after my first win. I tried to qualify for the Asian Tour last year but failed. I will try again this year. But this win shows me that I am good enough to have won on the China Tour and I am able to go a step further,"" said Liu, also a second-year pro. The DP World Tour is another goal, even though he concedes he may be too far behind Li on the money list to catch him. ""Still, I will try to qualify for the DP World Tour. I would be exempt into the final stage of Q-school as a top-three player on the China Tour. I don\'t want to miss the boat. I enjoy my tour life. I love golf and travel, I can see many new places,"" said Liu. Li, in contrast, said he preferred not to think about what's at stake. ""I know I dominate now, but anything could change at the Volvo China Open where the purse is $1.5 million. I don\'t want more stress. The greens in Suzhou are different from last week (in Hangzhou). I need to spend more time on the greens,"" he said. No matter who finishes top of the money list, Li is looking to the future with confidence. ""In 2020 and 2021, I hit the bottom and was struggling with self-doubt. But you know, it could be a blessing in disguise. Everyone can slump at some point in their career. I learned and grew from the experience,"" he said. ""I will also try to qualify for the Japan Tour. I think it\'s a good place for me to develop. And I also have a chance to play on the European Tour.""",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202310/20/6531d4dda3109068cafe7c01.jpeg'],['Liu Enhua tracks a drive during the first round of the Mitsubishi Electric FA Golf Open in Suzhou on Thursday.

With the Olympics serving as the pinnacle of the sporting year, Hassan and Tebogo's performances in Paris were pivotal to their recognition. Hassan made history by becoming the first woman to win medals in the 5,000m, 10,000m, and marathon at a single Olympics. The 31-year-old clinched gold in the marathon with an Olympic record time of 2:22:55, just 37 hours after earning bronze in the 10,000m, and six days after her 5,000m bronze. This remarkable achievement places her alongside Emil Zatopek, who won medals in these three events at the Helsinki Games in 1952. Tebogo, meanwhile, became Botswana's first-ever Olympic champion by winning the men's 200m with an African record of 19.46 seconds. The 21-year-old also played a key role in helping Botswana secure silver in the men's 4x400m relay in Paris. Tebogo dipped under 20 seconds in the 200m nine times this season, demonstrating exceptional consistency. ""This is not just my achievement, it's a victory for all of Africa. Hearing my name called was a surprise, and I'm deeply grateful to everyone who has supported me,"" said Tebogo. In addition to the World Athlete of the Year title, Tebogo also took home the Men's Track Athlete of the Year award, while American star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone was named the Women's Track Athlete of the Year. McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own 400m hurdles world record twice in 2024, clocking 50.37 seconds to win Olympic gold and also contributing to the US 4x400m relay team's gold medal. Swedish pole vault icon Armand Duplantis and Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh received the Men's and Women's Field Athlete of the Year awards, respectively.

Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton ""for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks"", many asked why a prize for physics has gone to computer scientists for what is also an achievement in computer science. Even Hinton, a winner of the 2018 Turing Award and one of the ""godfathers of AI"", was himself ""extremely surprised"" at receiving the call telling him he had got the Nobel in physics, while the other recipient Hopfield said ""It was just astounding."" Actually, the artificial neural network research has a lot to do with physics. Most notably, Hopfield replicated the functioning of the human brain by using the self-rotation of single molecules as if they were neurons and linking them together into a network, which is what the famous Hopfield neural network is about. In the process, Hopfield used two physical equations. Similarly, Hinton made Hopfield's approach the basis for a more sophisticated artificial neural network called the Boltzmann machine, which can catch and correct computational errors. The two steps have helped in forming a net that can act like a human brain and compute. The neural networks today can learn from their own mistakes and constantly improve, thus being able to solve complicated problems for humanity. For example, the Large Language Model that's the basis of the various GPT technologies people use today dates back to the early days when Hopfield and Hinton formed and improved their network. Instead of weakening the role of physics, that the Nobel Prize in Physics goes to neural network achievements strengthens it by revealing to the world the role physics, or fundamental science as a whole, plays in sharpening technology. Physics studies the rules followed by particles and the universe and paves the way for modern technologies. That is why there is much to thank physicists for the milestones modern computer science has crossed.

In a recent interview with Gong Ziming, he discusses his journey and pursuit of inspiration. As the winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in literature, Mo Yan has been hailed as a writer ""who, with hallucinatory realism, merges folk tales, history and the contemporary"". From his early novel, Red Sorghum, and the avant-garde works, Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out and Frog, to his latest traditional Chinese opera composition, Jin Yi, and a collection of poems, Qi Xing Yao Wo (Seven Stars Shine on Me), the works of Mo Yan depict a world that\'s both familiar and strange to us. In his literary creations, we see a world where animals, great and small, as well as people, display various personalities and drive a narrative. His work is deeply rooted in the earth and is full of vigor and tenacity, and he talks about how his hometown, Dongbei township in Gaomi county in East China\'s Shandong province - which he describes as being ""as large as a stamp"" - has nourished his spiritual world. Question: You have said that your hometown is the soul of your novels, and that the land and rivers, crops and trees, birds and animals, myths and legends, demons and ghosts, benefactors and enemies in your hometown are all source materials of your works. When and how did you start to include these elements in your writing? Answer: I personally believe that Yasunari Kawabata's novels had a great impact on contemporary Chinese writers. I've read The Dancing Girl of Izu and Snow Country, and one of my short novels titled White Dog and Swing Frame was inspired by a line in that book. The line depicts a strong black Akita squatting on a rock licking hot water from a pool. I envisioned a vivid picture: a snow-covered street, a steaming pool beside the street and a big black dog with its tongue sticking out. This is not only a picture but also a melody, a tone, a perspective of description and the start of a novel. I was very excited - it felt like the touch of a girl that I long admired. I suddenly realized what my novel was and what and how I should write it. Before that, I was troubled, unable to find suitable stories or my own voice. This line in Yasunari's novel was like a lighthouse in the darkness, illuminating my path. I put the book down and began writing lines, such as ""Dongbei township in Gaomi is home to a kind of meek white dog, but a purebred one is very hard to find after generations of breeding"". It was the first time for ""Dongbei township in Gaomi"" to appear in my work. The novel White Dog and Swing Frame was later translated into multiple languages. Ever since, I\'ve held the banner of ""Dongbei township in Gaomi"" like a grassroots hero, beginning the construction of my literary world. Before that, or before I read about the Akita, I was not able to find inspiration. I followed the guidance in textbooks, and experienced life in the countryside and factories. However, even after I came back, I could still not think of what to write about. Akita made me realize that a dog could be the subject, and so could the hot water. Ever since, I have never worried about finding sources for my novels. Whenever I was writing a book, the next was like a cackling hen right behind me. In the past, it was me writing the novels. However, it later became the novels writing me, and I became a slave to them.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201904/04/5ca56736a3104842e4a729bb.jpeg'],['Mo Yan attends a reading forum in Shenzhen.[Photo provided to China Daily]'],2019-04-04 09:56,Gong Ziming,"- **Main Topics:**

- Loaded terms: ""folk tales"", ""hallucinatory realism"" might create a biased view of traditional Chinese culture.
- Euphemisms: Mentioning Dongbei township as the ""soul of novels"" and labeling it an ""ideal place"" could be seen as romanticizing its importance.

4. Intended Audience Impact:
- The article aims to evoke emotions, particularly curiosity and admiration for Mo Yan's work and his hometown.
- This might lead readers to appreciate Chinese literature more or become interested in exploring the country's unique cultural heritage.

""We are moving from 40 percent female participation at Sochi 2014 to 47 percent in Milano Cortina. We are committed to continuing to advance gender equality, and Milano Cortina will be another key milestone in this endeavor,"" IOC President Thomas Bach said. Nordic Combined will be the only event without women at the 2026 Winter Olympics, as the women's event has only had one World Championship and only 10 National Federations competed. The IOC EB decided to add eight new events as ski mountaineering has new inclusion of men's and women's sprints and mixed relay, while skiing competitions also has three new events of men's and women's freestyle dual moguls, as well as ski jumping women's large hill individual. Skeleton mixed team event is added into bobsleigh and a women's doubles event is included into luge. Men's doubles luge replaces the open doubles and Alpine mixed team parallel is removed from the Olympics. In addition to emphasizing gender equality, these changes are consistent with the goal to lower the cost and complexity of hosting the Olympic Winter Games by utilizing existing venues and adhering to the overall athlete quota of 2,900. The future of Nordic Combined at the Winter Games is unclear, as the IOC is not committing to keeping the event in 2030 unless more audiences and athletes participate. The IOC EB also discussed the status of the Nordic Combined.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The intended effect is likely to instill trust in the IOC's commitment to gender equality. The use of formal language and objective statements helps to establish credibility.

**Summary:**
The International Olympic Committee has approved a record number of women's events for the 2026 Winter Olympics, with 47% female participation expected. This move aims to advance gender equality, but some concerns have been raised about the Nordic Combined event's future participation.

**Additional Insights:**

* The language used in the article implies that there may be underlying biases or agendas driving the IOC's decision-making process.
* The emphasis on increasing women's participation suggests that the IOC is prioritizing this goal over other considerations, such as cost and complexity concerns."

The Social Democrats gained 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament with 20.8percent of votes, state broadcaster RUV reported, making the party leader Kristrun Frostadottir, among the favourites to become prime minister. ""It very much depends on whether she can convince the president that she is the most likely to be able to form a coalition,"" Stefania Oskarsdottir, political scientist at the University of Iceland said. Frostadottir, 36, took over as Social Democratic party leader two years ago and has championed the Nordic welfare model, vowing to tackle a cost-of-living crisis sparked by high inflation and borrowing costs. Alternatively, current prime minister and leader of the conservative Independence Party, Bjarni Benediktsson, could continue at the helm, Oskarsdottir said, adding that it could become difficult to form a coalition. ""It\'s obvious that three parties are needed to form a coalition and it might prove somewhat tricky,"" she said. Benediktsson came second with 19.4percent of votes, gaining 14 seats after a late surge in support, while the Liberal Reform Party was third with 15.8percent and 11 seats. Parties require 32 seats for a majority in the Althingi parliament. ""It seems that the Reform Party is critical in this because they have the option of joining a coalition with the Social Democrats and the People\'s Party, and they also have the option of forming a coalition with the Independence Party and the Centre Party,"" Oskarsdottir said. The Left-Green Movement, part of the previous three-party ruling coalition and formerly led by Katrin Jakobsdottir before she stepped down as prime minister in April to run for president, failed to win any seats. The Pirate Party also lost all of its seats, meaning only six parties will have a spot in parliament, compared to eight parties previously.

86,Immigrants -- scapegoats in US governance dilemma,"('Nobel',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\04\WS67287e6fa310f1265a1cb533.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/04/WS67287e6fa310f1265a1cb533.html,"BEIJING -- The United States, a country built by waves of immigrants, is now grappling with a dilemma of illegal immigration, which has become both a flashpoint and a partisan weapon in American politics. As Republicans and Democrats turn to immigration as a defining issue in the presidential election campaign, genuine solutions appear increasingly out of reach. Instead, immigration has become a high-stakes game, with each side focusing more on how to exploit the issue than addressing its complex underlying causes. CARD FOR POLITICS In recent months, immigration has soared to the top of voters' concerns. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center revealed that about 60 percent of Americans now view immigration as important to their vote, up significantly from previous years. While Republican and Democrat politicians have both responded with intensified rhetoric, they have done little to bridge their divide on how to handle the issue. Instead, state and federal authorities are caught in conflicts that reflect the country's deepening partisan split. Last year, Republican-led states including Texas and Florida transported undocumented immigrants to Democratic strongholds like New York, Washington, D.C. and Chicago. Early this year, in order to deter migrant crossing, Texas deployed National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border, laid concertina wire border barriers and prevented federal agents from monitoring the border, highlighting the lack of a coordinated national approach. As the presidential election looms, Democrats and Republicans are doubling down on immigration as a means to rally their bases. Democrats continue to advocate for policies that portray them as champions of immigrant rights, emphasizing humane treatment and protections. While the Democratic stance resonates with their core supporters, it also serves an electoral strategy: immigrants and their descendants represent a growing and potentially reliable base for the party. However, with an increasing number of voters in favor of stronger immigration control, Democrats have started to shift their position. In June, President Joe Biden issued an executive order restricting asylum claims, limiting legal pathways at the US-Mexico border in a rare departure from the party's traditional stance. Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has echoed this shift, advocating for both legalization pathways and stronger border enforcement. Republicans, meanwhile, have adopted an increasingly hardline stance, framing immigration as a national security threat and opposing any form of legalization for undocumented immigrants. The Trump camp has ramped up its rhetoric, promising to conduct mass deportation if elected and blaming undocumented immigrants for issues like housing shortages and inflation, aiming to weaken support for Democrats among minority and union voters. However, despite both parties' claims to prioritize voter interests, neither side has developed practical, actionable solutions. Democrats and Republicans alike focus on exploiting immigration as a wedge issue, stirring up partisan animosity without tackling the root causes of the problem. DEEP FLAWS IN GOVERNANCE The immigration issue has exposed structural weaknesses in American governance. Historically, US immigration policies were skewed in favor of Europeans, while those from Asia and Latin America faced heavy restrictions, pushing many into illegal pathways. Undocumented immigrants have been an indispensable element in the US society for decades. They have filled the need for essential yet low-paying and high-risk jobs that citizens largely passed up, promoted consumption, and brought benefits to the US economy. However, the group remains marginalized and vulnerable. A recent Pew Research Center survey revealed that three-quarters of US voters believe undocumented immigrants primarily take jobs that Americans don't want to do, with 90 percent of Harris supporters and 59 percent of Trump supporters sharing that view respectively. Despite this wide acknowledgment of immigrants' contributions, both legal and undocumented immigration have emerged as charged topics in the Nov 5 election. At the forefront of the debate is a growing call for control, with some even pushing for large-scale deportations. Why, after years of dependency on immigrant labor, has immigration become such a heated political issue in the United States? The answer lies, in part, in a shifting economic landscape that has seen newcomers painted as scapegoats. In a time of economic uncertainties, critics argue that recent waves of undocumented immigrants now compete with low-skilled American workers, intensifying existing domestic job pressures. The decline in social mobility, as class divisions harden, compounds these anxieties. The United States has seen the biggest gap between the rich and the poor since the Great Depression in 1929. As noted by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz during the 2022 James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Lecture in Economic Inequality, hosted by the Institute of Politics, the United States has ""more inequality than other countries and remarkably less equality of opportunity than almost any other country."" Locked into this tense economic environment, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle face mounting public pressure. Once willing to negotiate and collaborate on nuanced immigration reform, Republicans and Democrats now find themselves at an impasse. And miserably, immigrants have fallen victim to deepening political polarization. Neither side can afford to alienate wealthy donors or find palatable solutions to create enough jobs, increase incomes and narrow the gap between the wealthy and the poor to alleviate voters' frustrations. As a result, rather than seeking a bipartisan approach to address immigration constructively, they have taken to using undocumented immigrants, who cannot vote in the elections, as convenient scapegoats in the political battle.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/04/67287e6fa310f1268d842d3f.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202411/04/67287e6fa310f1268d842d41.jpeg']","['Attendees arrive for a rally against Proposition 314 organized by immigrant rights activists in Phoenix, Arizona, US, Oct 20, 2024.

- **Mentions of Sweden:** There are no mentions of Sweden in the article.","Here's the nuanced analysis of the article:

**Tone and Style:**
The tone is critical and neutral, with a hint of objectivity. The author presents a balanced view, allowing different perspectives to be heard without taking a clear stance. Notable stylistic features include emotional language (""scaped"", ""anxieties""), formal tone (use of complex sentences), and rhetorical devices such as repetition (""immigration has become..."") and metaphor (""immigrants have fallen victim to deepening political polarization"").

**Implied Motives:**
The implied motives behind the article are:

* To promote an agenda by framing immigration as a divisive issue that polarizes politicians and voters.
* To persuade the audience through emotive language and vivid descriptions of the consequences of inaction on immigration.
* To highlight the complexities of the issue and create a sense of urgency, rather than providing straightforward solutions or talking points.

**Subtle Implications:**
The article subtly implies:

* The potential for undocumented immigrants to be scapegoats for societal ills, contributing to economic inequality and social divisions.
* The dangers of xenophobic rhetoric and policies that blame certain groups for economic struggles.
* The tension between the need for immigration reform and the challenges of addressing the root causes of migration.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The article aims to instill fear, create distrust, and foster doubt among readers about the feasibility of finding bipartisan solutions to address immigration. By portraying Republicans and Democrats as competing on a partisan issue rather than working together to find common ground, the author seeks to discourage cooperation and undermine trust in institutions.

**Summary (1-2 sentences):**
The article highlights the growing divide between Republicans and Democrats over immigration reform, with both sides using undocumented immigrants as a wedge issue. By framing the debate in terms of competing values and interests, the authors aim to create an emotionally charged narrative that polarizes readers rather than sparking meaningful discussion."

""As a 34-year-old sprinter, I have sustained many injuries through the years which have made it difficult to prepare for this season. I have been struggling to cope physically with my training, and my team has conducted a series of tests on my body. I have also sought advice and help from many people. ""Therefore, based on expert medical opinion and after discussions with my team, I have to give up on this season. A period of rest and recuperation is required to ensure I can have a longer athletic career. I will pay close attention to the forthcoming world championships and the Asian Games, and I will be cheering for all of Team China\'s athletes."" The shock announcement instantly became a trending topic on Chinese social media. The hashtag ""Su Bingtian quits 2023 world championships and Asian Games"" had been viewed over 15 million times in just an hour, with netizens wishing the veteran a speedy recovery. Su has been one of China's brightest stars on the track in recent years. He dashed into the history books at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 by becoming the first Chinese to reach an Olympic 100m final, refreshing the Asian record to 9.83 seconds in the process in his semifinal. Last year, Su became an Olympic medalist after Team China was promoted to third place in the men's 4x100m relay final in Tokyo due to the disqualification of second-place Britain over a failed drugs test. In 2015, Su became the first-ever Asian-born sprinter to break the 10-second barrier in the 100m. In 2018, he twice equaled the previous Asian record of 9.91, and clocked 9.92 to take that year's Asian Games 100m title in Jakarta. As the reigning Asian Games 100m champion, Su was expected to be one of the main attractions for home fans in Hangzhou. His best performance this season was a 60m gold (6.59 sec) at an indoor meet in Gothenburg, Sweden in February. ""Su started this season with a victory in February, which was considered a sign that the veteran could shine at the world championships and the Asian Games this year. After that indoor event, Su originally planned to compete in more events to level up his condition,"" read a commentary by thepaper.cn. ""Su Bingtian had already said that Hangzhou could be his last Asian Games and he really hoped to go for glory again on the track. He has reached the twilight of his career. He has trained for the last two years in Guangdong, where he also acted as a mentor for younger runners. ""Su has been trying his best to maintain his own fitness. He wanted to display the persistence which will inspire the younger generation to keep up his pace."" Su stressed that he is not entertaining any thoughts of retirement just yet, and should his recovery go as planned, he will be targeting a spot at next year's Paris Olympics. ""I won\'t stop chasing my dreams. I will use this period to recover and I will prepare as best I can for the Paris Olympics,"" he wrote on Weibo. ""I want to thank everyone for all their care and support. See you again next season."" Su's withdrawal is a blow to Team China's hopes of topping the podium in Hangzhou, with the recent form of other nations  particularly Japan  suggesting the host faces an uphill task to claim gold in the 100m and 4x100m competitions. Xie Zhenye will now spearhead China's challenge in Hangzhou. The 29-year-old holds the 200m Asian record and was a member of the medal-winning 4x100m relay team in Tokyo. Xie's fastest 100m time this season was 10.05 in Chongqing earlier this month after spending months at a training camp in the United States. ""The national championships were the first event I participated in since my return from the training camp, where I made many adjustments,"" said Xie after the nationals. ""I\'ve still got the trials for the Asian Games and world championships to come this year. These are all tough challenges, and I will have to keep leveling up. I feel like I\'ve been pretty solid this year.

The overall tone of the article is neutral, with an objective approach to reporting Su Bingtian's announcement. However, there are moments of emotional language and rhetorical flair, particularly in Su's Weibo post where he expresses gratitude for his team's support and appreciation from fans.

**Stylistic features:**

* Emotional language: The use of words like ""shock"", ""inspiring"", ""persuasive"" creates an emotive tone.
* Formal vs. informal tone: The article adopts a formal tone in terms of the text, but Su's Weibo post is more informal and conversational.
* Use of rhetorical devices: There are instances of repetition (""I have been struggling to cope physically with my training"", ""Su has sustained many injuries through the years"") which creates a sense of rhythm and emphasizes his determination.

**Implied motives:**
The article implies that Su Bingtian's decision is not solely driven by physical injuries, but also by a desire to maintain his career and showcase his continued competitiveness. The tone of the article suggests that he may be trying to avoid retirement, which could be motivated by a mix of factors, including personal and professional reasons.

**Subtle implications:**

* Loaded terms: Phrases like ""shock announcement"" and ""trending topic on Chinese social media"" create an impression that Su's decision is significant and attention-grabbing.
* Euphemisms: The use of phrases like ""my physical condition"" creates a sense of vagueness, which could be intended to avoid revealing the true nature of his injuries.

**Intended audience impact:**
The article speculates that Su Bingtian's decision may have implications for Team China's chances in Hangzhou, suggesting that it could be a blow to their hopes of topping the podium. However, this is speculative and not explicitly stated by Su himself.

**Summary:**
Su Bingtian announces his retirement from athletics due to injuries, citing a need for rest and recuperation after sustained injuries over the past two years. The article speculates that he may be trying to maintain his career and avoid retirement, but its tone suggests that this is not solely driven by these factors.

This region features ancient structures like the Great Wall from the Qin (221-206 BC) and Han (206 BC- 220 AD) dynasties, the Great Wall of the Six Frontier Towns erected during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), and the Tang Dynasty\'s ""Shouxiang City"" fortresses, which are critical military defense cities in the Hetao region. Furthermore, the Jin Dynasty\'s (1115-1234) Great Wall predominantly traverses the Hulunbuir and Xilingol grasslands. The Great Wall in the Juyan Lake area erected during the Han Dynasty (206 BC- 220 AD): Situated north of the Mu Us Desert and the Tengger Desert, this region was rich in water and grass resources, coupled with a favorable climate, making it highly suitable for agricultural cultivation. Consequently, it became a region of significant protection and development during the Han Dynasty. Recognizing the strategic importance of the Hexi Corridor, Emperor Wu of Han commanded the construction of the Great Wall segment from Zhangye to Juyan Lake in 102 BC. A force of 180,000 soldiers was dispatched to the northern territories of Jiuquan and Zhangye to safeguard the corridor. Furthermore, the Han Dynasty continued the westward expansion of the Great Wall, stretching its reach to Yanze, now recognized as Lop Nur in Xinjiang. The Han Great Wall in this area was not merely a defensive line but was also equipped with early warning systems, including beacon towers and watchtowers, which were used for border surveillance and military protection. The discovery of the Juyan Han Great Wall has a fascinating backstory steeped in legend. In 1930, Swedish archaeologist Warlock Bergman embarked on an archaeological expedition to Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolias Alxa League as part of the Northwest Scientific Expedition. During his explorations, he stumbled upon the ruins of a courtyard wall beneath a heavily weathered hilltop beacon tower, along with some abandoned houses. While meticulously measuring this rectangular wall, Bergman accidentally dropped his pen. As he bent down to pick it up, he made an astonishing find: a remarkably well-preserved Han Dynasty coin lying right next to his pen. He also found another coin with the character ""wuzhu"" inscribed on it, along with a bronze arrowhead. This fortunate accident, triggered by a simple pen slip, gradually revealed the mysterious secrets of the Juyan Han Great Wall, providing invaluable evidence for the study of the Han Dynasty\'s border defense system. The ""Shouxiang City"" fortresses in the Tang Dynasty (618-907): Although the Tang Dynasty didn\'t construct the Great Wall on the same large scale as the Qin and Han dynasties, it did build numerous military defense facilities along the northern border and stationed troops there. To defend against Turkish invasions, the Tang Dynasty established the Shuofang Army near the existing Qin and Han Great Wall. The Tang Dynasty built three key military fortresses known as ""Shouxiang City"" along the Qin and Han Great Wall. These fortresses became the core of the Tang Dynasty\'s northern defense system, around which a robust defense network was constructed. The Great Wall of Jin Dynasty (1115-1234): During the latter part of Emperor Zhangzong\'s reign in the Jin Dynasty, border security began to deteriorate as various Mongol tribes gradually united. Compared to the increasingly powerful Mongol tribes, the Jin Dynasty\'s military strength waned, making it a primary target for Mongol attacks. In 1206, Genghis Khan unified the Mongol tribes and established the Mongol Empire, posing a serious threat to the northern border of the Jin Dynasty. In response to these Mongol attacks, the Jin Dynasty began large-scale construction of the Great Wall. The section built in the Lingbei area served as a defensive line against Mongol cavalry raids. In Inner Mongolia, this part of the Jin Dynasty\'s Great Wall became known locally as the ""Genghis Khan Border Wall.""","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/06/6661803ca31082fc2b6f6132.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/06/6661803da31082fc2b6f6138.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/06/6661803da31082fc2b6f613d.jpeg']","['The Great Wall and beacon towers in the Juyan Lake area, were erected during the Han Dynasty (206 BC- 220 AD).

Although in the past, the relatively slow progress of science and technology in China almost became Achilles' heel for development, the country today has made remarkable achievements in almost every science and technology field. In 2021, China became the leading country in filing applications for new patents. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, China's intellectual property office received 1.59 million patent applications (out of a total of 3.4 million filed worldwide in 2021). It was followed by the US, Japanese, Republic of Korea and European patent offices. China led the field in 2022 and 2023, too. China was ranked 12th in the 2023 Global Innovation Index, becoming the only middle-income country to break into the top 15. Needless to say, it ranked No 1 among middle-income economies. Also in 2023, for the first time China topped the list of countries with the highest number of science and technology clusters, having 24 in total. The United States and Germany followed with 21 and nine clusters respectively. China is now a leader in many cutting-edge technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, financial technology, 5G, as well as electric vehicles, robots and drones. It is also one of the world's largest investors in and users of digital technologies. With a strong venture capital industry focusing on fostering advanced digital technologies and innovations, China is home to one-third of the world's unicorns (start-ups with a value of over $1 billion). As such, innovation is no longer the ""Achilles\' heel"" of the economy; instead, it has become Pegasus and is carrying China toward modernization. How does that help the world? China\'s unique economic philosophy of win-win cooperation, the opposite of the West\'s zero-sum game in which ""the winner takes all"", is based on sharing the fruits of its modernization and innovations with other countries. As the global leader in railways, port, bridge and tunnel construction technology, China has been sharing it with Belt and Road partner countries. This shows the mutually beneficial nature of the Belt and Road Initiative which has enabled China to build some of the best infrastructure in the developing world  the first high-speed railway in Indonesia, the China-Laos high-speed railway, the Lekki deep seaport in Nigeria and the magnificent Peljesac Bridge in Croatia, to name but a few. By developing clean technologies, Chinese companies are helping many countries, including European Union member states and non-Belt and Road countries, to transition to green development. A large percentage of the electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, and critical minerals used in clean technology and digital industries in the US and the EU are imported from China, which has become the global leader in this field. China, which also leads in space exploration, is helping many countries place Earth-observing and telecommunications satellites in orbit and has invited all countries to benefit from its space program. Interestingly, a report by the United States Institute of Peace published in September 2023 said Beijing has made support for the development of African countries\' space programs a key incentive for the continent to establish closer ties with China. ""By contrast"", it added ""although US federal agencies and universities are actively involved in research partnerships with some African countries, space technology has not been a focus of US foreign policy in Africa."" Speaking at the China-Africa Leaders\' Dialogue on Aug 24, 2023, in Johannesburg, the top Chinese leader said China was committed to promoting the modernization of Africa. Accordingly, China launched the ""Initiative on Supporting Africa\'s Industrialization"" to boost Africa\'s manufacturing sector and help the continent realize industrialization and economic diversification, and the ""Plan for China Supporting Africa\'s Agricultural Modernization"" to expand the grain growing areas, and encourage Chinese companies to increase investment in Africa\'s agriculture sector and strengthen cooperation with Africa. It has also launched the ""Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development"" to train 500 principals and outstanding teachers from vocational colleges every year, and teach 10,000 technicians vocational skills, and implemented the ""China-Africa Universities 100 Cooperation Plan"" and the 10 pilot exchange programs for China-Africa partner institutes. But these cooperation initiatives are not charities or aid programs; they are initiatives to promote mutual and equitable growth. It's time the world embraced China's development philosophy, for it benefits all and helps advance civilization with innovation as its guiding principle.

91,Innovative workforce crucial for future reform,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202407\15\WS66945872a31095c51c50df81.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/15/WS66945872a31095c51c50df81.html,"China's economic growth over the past more than four decades has been truly incredible. Since China launched reform and opening-up in 1978, its GDP growth has averaged above 9 percent a year, and it has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty. It has also significantly improved healthcare, education and other services. China's opening-up and rapid economic development began with Shenzhen. While millions of workers and huge amounts of resources were brought in to Shenzhen and other coastal regions, energy was sourced from other regions or imported to fuel economic growth. And the goods manufactured in the coastal regions were shipped through Hong Kong port and airport. Guangdong province, where Shenzhen is located, had and still has insufficient energy resources, and it meets most of its energy requirements through supplies from other parts of China or imports. Economic growth has benefited Chinese society in many ways. For example, in 1989, Guangdong had a total of 16 kilometers of expressways. In 2023, it had more than 11,000 km of expressways. In 1992, Guangdong had no subways. By 2023, Guangzhou city alone had 16 subway lines covering 653 km, while Shenzhen had 16 subway lines totaling 431 km. In 1990 Guangdong's GDP was a mere 155.9 billion yuan ($21.44 billion). In 2023, its GDP exceeded 13 trillion yuan; making it the 12th largest economy in the world. Today, most of the global supply chains are connected to China in some way or the other. However, as the cost of energy-intensive and labor-intensive production has risen significantly in China, companies are relocating to lower-cost manufacturing locations. This may appear to be a problem, but it's not. The Chinese mainland is simply on a path other countries and regions have tread to achieve higher value production. The Chinese mainland, on its part, is creating more high-wage, high-value jobs, as it knows that harnessing the potential of existing workers is key to maintaining economic productivity. After the end of World War II, Japan gradually became the workshop of the world by being one of few countries that could provide unskilled labor and cheap land for manufacturers both from home and abroad. Those people who grew up in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and are familiar with the friction between the United States and Japan in later years know that most simple things during those years were labeled ""Made in Japan"". By the mid-1970s, many of those items started being labeled ""Made in South Korea"", followed by ""Made in Taiwan"" and ""Made in Hong Kong"". And by the mid-1990s, the labels had mostly changed to ""Made in China"". These developments demonstrate a natural transition which, over the years, took place in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and is now taking place on the mainland. Each of these economies began their development by manufacturing low-technology, low labor-cost and energy-intensive products for export. However, given the increase in their literacy rate and skilled labor force, and high-tech development, it made perfect business sense for them to shift their low-end production to other economies that welcomed it. Such a transition, however, is a bittersweet medicine, always associated with difficult and sometimes painful policy decisions. Nonetheless, to transform itself into the next secure, consumer-based economy, China needs to make hard decisions. China's working-age population peaked at 1 billion in 2014, dipping in the last few years. China's working-age population has been declining by an estimated 7.9 million a year since 2020 and will drop to about 58.6 percent of the total population by 2030. And by 2100, China is projected to have a workforce of less than 400 million. This problem is not unique to China. Dozens of countries in Asia, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania, including Germany, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Portugal, Ghana, India, Mexico and New Zealand are, to varying degrees, issuing passports based on ancestry, with some of them granting dual citizenship based on genetic linkage. This is especially important to countries such as Mexico which, in particular, have been attracting large investments in the manufacturing sector. Challenging times call for innovative solutions. China has become the world's largest economy (according to GDP purchasing power parity). It is also the world's biggest manufacturer and trader in goods, and has the largest foreign exchange reserves. As a result, it has become a major commercial partner of the US. China is the US' largest merchandise trading partner, biggest source of imports, and third-largest export market. It is also the largest foreign holder of US Treasury securities. Despite a record number of graduates entering the job market this year, China still faces a shortage of skilled personnel, especially in the manufacturing sector. According to a survey published in 2022 by China International Intellectech Corporation, 83 percent of manufacturers face difficulties in recruiting skilled workers. A manufacturing talent development guide issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and other departments said China may face a shortage of about 30 million skilled workers in 10 critical manufacturing sectors by 2025. Increasing investment in the country's workforce and taking bold and innovative steps to attract and retain talent is key to unlocking a stronger and more stable economy. And China is mostly doing what needs to be done to realize that goal. Harley Seyedin is the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China.

""It has been really fascinating! This class was a good opportunity to actually explore the city,"" said Ellsworth, from Rhodes College in Memphis. Ellsworth was among a group of students from different countries who joined a cycling course offered by the Peking University Summer School International 2023. During the course, which lasted a month, students had the opportunity to gain cycling knowledge and skills, while joining cycle tours to explore the ancient charms of Beijing. ""We hope that students from all over the world can experience the long history of the ancient capital, including the grandeur of royal architecture, and explore the beauty of the city from different perspectives,"" said course lecturer Lu Fuquan, who is an associate professor. A total of 51 students from seven countries and regions, including China, Sweden, Australia and Malaysia, have joined the course. According to Lu, six cycling routes were designed to enhance students' exploration of the historical beauty of the city. These routes not only include popular tourist sites such as the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and the Jingshan Park, but also feature places such as museums, theaters and former residences of celebrities. The Central Axis of Beijing formed a major part of these cycling tours. First created in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), the Beijing Central Axis, or Zhongzhouxian, stretches 7.8 km between the Yongding Gate in the south of the city and the Drum Tower and Bell Tower in the north. Most of the major old-city buildings of Beijing sit along this axis. The students visited more than 10 important sites along the Central Axis. Neither the recent high temperatures in the city, nor the occasional rainy weather, managed to reduce the enthusiasm of the students, who kept on riding wearing either sun hats or raincoats. Ellsworth, who has been learning Chinese for six years but had never previously set foot in China, was fascinated by these historical sites. ""I\'ve read about them in books and I have heard about various dynasties, but it\'s another thing to actually walk in these historical places, and to just see that they are still there and people still care about them."" Gabriel Barnagaud, an art history major from Ecole du Louvre in France, said he gained a lot of interesting knowledge during the cycling course, especially by visiting museums and venues with different types of architecture. ""The Forbidden City is probably one of my favorite Beijing venues, and the whole area around it is full of wonderful sceneries and buildings,"" he said. ""The Central Axis offers lots of important things along its long way. It\'s really impressive and I feel very small compared to it."" Jiang Yatong, a student from the National University of Singapore, believes that cycling is like a ""moveable feast,"" and found that the image of Beijing became increasingly profound as the cycling course went on. The colors of ancient architecture and little sculptures of animals visible on the roofs of palaces all made a strong impact on her, ""as if every brick and every tile have their own stories."" At the end of the course, Ellsworth began to look forward to her next visit to China. ""I plan on coming back at some point in the future, because I feel like even if I came here like 30 or 40 times, and I spent months here every time, I still wouldn\'t have seen everything,"" she said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202308/21/64e32237a310352610bb1286.jpeg'],['[Photo/Xinhua]'],2023-08-21 17:09,Xinhua,"- **Main Topics:**

93,Integrated megapolises next stage of reform,"('Nordic',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202406\11\WS666783f7a31082fc043cbba9.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/11/WS666783f7a31082fc043cbba9.html,"After record rapid urbanization, China is moving to the next stage with the development of integrated and coordinated multi-city clusters. The Yangtze River Delta region is a case in point. To identify the best ways to advance the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta region, President Xi Jinping chaired a symposium in Shanghai in November 2023. Half a decade before that, the president had championed an initiative that made the integrated development of the delta region a national strategy. From the standpoint of development, I believe China has entered the next stage of reform and opening-up, essential to propel Chinese modernization. The Yangtze River is China's longest waterway. Running more than 6,300 kilometers, it encompasses a set of economic powerhouses and megacities, including the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, and the megapolis of Shanghai. Between 2018 and 2022, the Yangtze River Delta region's GDP grew at an average annual rate of about 5.5 percent, accounting for 24 percent of the national total  the region's GDP exceeds that of Japan's. Recently, Tesla inaugurated its new megapack battery factory in Shanghai, which highlighted the US carmaker's increasing investment in China amid intense competition. Among other industrial ecosystems, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is a major automobile production base, and a hub of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including a variety of electric vehicles. With chip and software sourced from Shanghai, batteries from Jiangsu, die-casting machines from Zhejiang, an NEV factory in the YRD region can reportedly acquire all the auto parts within a four-hour drive. From microchips to large aircraft, and cloud computing to artificial intelligence, coordination among these locations fosters industrial transformation and upgrading in the region. Because of its status as one of the most economically vibrant regions in China, the YRD city cluster has attracted major State-owned and private enterprises, and a large number of Fortune 500 companies for setting up headquarters in China. As an increasingly diversified industrial, financial, retail and corporate hub, Shanghai can drive regional clusters while benefiting from their complementary strengths. But Shanghai is not alone. It is developing in tandem with China's other major regional growth engines. Consider these important facts of development. In 1950, only 13 percent of the Chinese people lived in cities. By 1980, just after China launched reform and opening-up, the figure had increased to 19 percent. Since then, it has soared to a stunning 66 percent, with the initial urbanization drive taking off in the special economic zones of the largely coastal first- and second-tier cities. Now, urbanization is intensifying even in third- and fourth-tier cities. Moreover, the development momentum is shifting from urbanization toward the integration of major regional city clusters. China has several major ""megapolises"". In addition to the Yangtze River Delta region, the megapolises and economic hubs include the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city cluster), and the Chengdu-Chongqing dual-city hub. Furthermore, some emerging multi-city clusters have the potential to develop into new regional growth engines in a decade or two. Internationally, China's emerging megapolises also face competitive threats and cooperative opportunities from the regional engines of the advanced economies. As the world's leading global financial center, the New York Metropolitan Area hosts the headquarters of more than one-third of Fortune 500 companies in the United States. The San Francisco Bay Area is the heart of global innovation, which is coupled with Boston and its Ivy League research-oriented universities, such as Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Austin's energy cluster, Raleigh's Research Triangle and Seattle's Microsoft engine. These dynamic US regions compete with Western Europe's innovation-driven cities such as London, Berlin, Paris and the Nordic hubs. However, what makes Chinese cities unique is their ability to combine world-class innovation at affordable prices in a way that the rich economies can't. Over time, some major multi-city clusters in India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia have the potential to follow in the footprints. But whenever new challengers emerge, they face entrenched incumbents, some of which seek to retain their monopoly. From New York City to Los Angeles, farsighted Western metropolises and their mayors understand that businesses compete, whereas cities and countries cooperate, whereas cities and countries cooperate. By contrast, governments that prioritize win-lose geopolitics can't benefit from win-win cooperation. Some portray the rise of regional multi-city clusters as threats, rather than opportunities. They have tried to contain China's rise by targeting successful Chinese companies, such as Huawei, the information and communications technology giant, and Byte-Dance, the parent of TikTok. That has little to do with the ""competition"" they claim to tout. Instead, such efforts are reminiscent of colonial protectionism and imperial preferences that once legitimized monopolies in the name of Western supremacy. Today, terms differ, but goals don't. It is a geopolitical ploy to avoid real competition with the Global South. Today, it targets China. Tomorrow, it will target India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia. Mega protectionism should have no role in the 21st century.

The event is part of the cultural activities commemorating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France, Nicolas Pillerel, minister counselor for culture, education and scientific affairs at the French embassy in China, announced during a news conference on Oct 24. Established in 2009 by the French Embassy in China and French-speaking Chinese intellectuals, including Dong Qiang, author, translator and professor of French literature at Peking University, the Fu Lei prize is awarded for the translation of French books into Chinese, and also promotes the dissemination of these translations. Supported by intellectuals, including Nobel laureates in literature Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio and Mo Yan, the prize acknowledges the crucial role of translators as conveyors of words, as well as their role in bolstering cultural exchange between France and China. The prize is given in three categories  ""Literature"", ""Essay"", and since 2013, the ""Young Shoots"" category to encourage the next generation of translators. ""We are aware that without the participation and involvement of young people, and without the emergence of outstanding young translators, the translation industry will inevitably face a talent gap,"" says Dong. This year, 47 titles are competing for the Fu Lei prize, with 28 in the ""Essay"" category and 19 in the ""Literature"" category. Notably, 42 of the 60 translators were born after 1980. Yu Zhongxian, chairman of the jury this year, says that the finalists are younger than those in previous years, and a majority are women. In the ""Essay"" category, the original versions of some of the translations are lengthy, difficult books on which multiple people worked to complete the translation. In the ""Literature"" category, translations cover an impressive array, including not only books from the last century, but also those that reflect the contemporary lifestyles of young people in France. Yu says that, given the increasing variety of books introduced in recent years, there is a need for younger publishers to discover them, and for younger translators to translate them. Ten books  five about social sciences and five literary titles  made it to the final list and the winners will be announced in Beijing on Nov 30. The finalists include Francois Furet and Mona Ozouf's A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, Delphine de Vigan's novel Children Are Kings, which addresses the pitfalls of social networks, Dany Sandron's Notre-Dame de Paris: History and Archaeology of a Cathedral, and Nastassja Martin's In the Eye of the Wild, which explores the relationship between humans and nature. These books demonstrate the diversity and vitality of French-to-Chinese translations today. Since 2013, China has been the largest buyer of French copyrights abroad. Last year, 1,383 contracts were signed between French and Chinese publishers. ""The enduring appeal of French literature and thought is inseparable from the contribution of translators, and we should be grateful for their work. For this reason, we place great importance on supporting translators,"" says Pillerel. He says that translators are usually obscure like shadows, but that at least once a year, there is a need to ""cast the spotlight"" on them. In addition, the French embassy in China financially supports the publishing of at least 30 translations, in addition to translation training programs to nurture more young talent. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties, as well as the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism. Pillerel says that the series of activities organized by the French embassy around both themes throughout the year culminates with the prize.","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/31/6722d323a310f1268d83d883.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/31/6722d323a310f1268d83d888.jpeg']","['Books nominated for the 16th Fu Lei Translation and Publishing Prize.\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily]', 'From left: The jury chair of this year\'s Fu Lei Translation and Publishing Prize Yu Zhongxian, the event\'s organizing committee chair Dong Qiang, and last year\'s Fu Lei prize for Newcomer Award winner Lyu Junjun at the news conference.\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily] \\n""']",2024-10-31 08:43,YANG YANG,"- **Main Topics:**

The province's low temperatures are perfect for outdoor winter sports, giving local resorts significant appeal to large numbers of tourists, both domestic and foreign. Vanke Songhua Lake Resort, for example, is expected to attract 450,000 visitors during this winter season. During the 2017-18 winter season, the resort received 340,000 tourists and skiing enthusiasts from across the world. Statistics from the Jilin Department of Culture and Tourism showed that the province received nearly 62 million tourists between November 2016 and March 2017. Tourism revenue during the period hit 116 billion yuan ($16.72 billion), a surge of 27.12 percent year-on-year. Jilin has long been a strong player in China's winter sports scene, due to its high-quality facilities and rich snow and ice resources. The province has some of the country's most beautiful snowflakes and the kind of light powder snow that skiing fans love best of all.

99,Kiwi Muir powers to Electric finish in Suzhou,"('Volvo',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202310\23\WS6535c539a31090682a5ea0bf.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202310/23/WS6535c539a31090682a5ea0bf.html,"Late birdie blitz sees off rivals as New Zealander claims second China Tour title New Zealander Kieran Muir birdied three of the final four holes to win the Mitsubishi Electric FA Golf Open by one stroke in Jiangsu province on Sunday. The Kiwi took advantage of a late collapse by China's Ye Jianfeng (72), who led for much of the final round at Suzhou Taihu International Golf Club, to claim his second career China Tour title. He signed off with a 71 for an 11-under 277 total, enough to earn a winner's check of 90,000 yuan ($12,000). Li Linqiang, the China Tour Order of Merit leader, roared up the leaderboard with a final-round 67 to finish third, two shots back. Zhou Yanhan was the top amateur as the 15-year-old Chongqing native closed with a 68 to finish three shots off the pace in equal fourth with Czech Gordan Brixi, whose 65 was the lowest round of the tournament. Muir and Ye went into the final round as co-leaders on 10-under. As Muir could only muster 10 straight pars to start, Ye vaulted into a two-shot lead with birdies at the second and fourth holes. Muir picked up his first birdie at the 427-yard (390-meter) 11th to get within a stroke of Ye. After both players made bogey five at the 448-yard 12th, Muir looked out of it when he made further bogeys over the next two holes to fall three strokes behind. Starting at the 15th hole, however, Muir began a run of three straight birdies that would prove the difference. With Ye holding a one-stroke lead going into the penultimate hole, his tee shot with a pitching wedge at the 149-yard par-three found water. As Ye would stumble to a double-bogey five, Muir made a 70-foot (21-meter) birdie putt for a two-shot lead in what would be a three-shot swing. At the final hole, Muir made a par five as Ye sank a five-foot birdie putt to get close. ""Any win is special. It\'s very hard to win a golf tournament anywhere in the world. To win here again is really nice, makes me feel good. I\'m a second-time winner, so that\'s good,"" said Muir who turns 36 on Wednesday. ""Ye played very, very well. He had a really nice start and I got close and then I made three bogeys. Then I think \'tough work now\'. But I re-center, go back to my processes. I find a good place and make three birdies. Unfortunately, Benny (Ye) missed his swing on 17. But he\'s a great competitor and he deserves all he got this week. He\'s a good player."" Ye's runner-up finish marked his best result at a China Tour event, but he felt it was a missed opportunity to collect his first win as a pro. The 32-year-old said he injured himself at the Volvo China Open Qualifying Tournament in August. The following month, he finished seventh at the Guotai Open before missing the cut last week in Hainan. ""I felt relaxed at the 17th tee. I hit a good tee shot but I don\'t know what happened. As I said before, this is the will of heaven. I did my best and I just have to accept it,"" said the Guangzhou-based Ye. ""I didn\'t play golf for a month because of my injury, but I have made a lot of progress since Hainan. I will try again next week (in Zhejiang)."" Despite finishing fourth against a professional field, top amateur Zhou was anything but happy with his final round after coming out red hot with six birdies over the first seven holes. Next week, the teenager will play in the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship in Melbourne, Australia. ""I am not satisfied with this score since I had a really fantastic start,"" said Zhou, who sits 95th in the world amateur rankings. ""I made a 25-footer for a birdie at the first hole. My tee shots were great. My putter worked, too. After that, my putts didn\'t drop, much to my disappointment.""

The 26-year-old leads by one from overnight leader Liu Yue on 6-under with Chen Guxin in third just one shot adrift on 5-under. Winner of the 2016 Volvo China Open Li Haotong is also well within range in fourth place on four-under-par with the final round of China's National Open Golf Championship taking place on December 19. Starting the day four shots behind Liu, Zhang was one-under through 10 holes before bursting into life on the closing stretch, rolling in five of his seven birdies on the last eight holes for a storming inward nine of 31. ""It\'s not an easy course to play when the wind is very strong so I feel that I played very well,"" said Zhang, who admited his aim was just to make the weekend at the Volvo China Open and whose season\'s best in 2021 is a tie for sixth place at last month\'s Hengdian Championship. ""I was in a bad shape not too long ago so I\'m just enjoying playing and have no high expectations of myself. This course is very difficult and requires great accuracy so my aim was just to make the cut. I know I have the skills; it\'s just a matter of mentality. I think I have a chance so I\'ll go out tomorrow with no pressure on myself - again, no expectations - and just be happy."" Overnight leader Liu, who honed his game at the Genzon Golf Academy, again plotted his way around a 7,145-course he knows almost inside out. Two birdies on the front nine helped him stay at the top of the leaderboard until Zhang's birdie blitz saw him snatch the lead on a day when low scoring was at a premium. ""I was a little nervous but I just have to focus on my own ball,"" said Liu. ""But I have had a strategy over the first three days and, after some more putting practice, I will go out tomorrow and follow that strategy again."" With two DP World Tour titles to his name, Haotong Li carries considerable weight in the field, and despite an erratic season his presence in the leading groups could well prove influential going into the final round. Although his third round was again punctuated with moments he'd rather forget - namely a triple bogey seven - Li bounced back with seven birdies and an outstanding eagle two on the last to card a round of 67 (-5) and resurrect his hope of becoming the first Chinese player to win the Volvo China Open on two occasions. ""I haven\'t felt good about my game this week but golf is like that - even if you feel good it doesn\'t mean you are going to play well everything has to work well,"" he said after a five-under-par 67. ""The 18th was down wind and I was hoping to use it to at least get a birdie but I managed to cut it close and make eagle. Maybe I found some inspiration after that triple bogey on the fourth!"" Elsewhere, popular 17-year-old amateur Ding Wenyi saw his title chances suffer a huge setback thanks to a quadruple bogey nine on the 17th that saw him finish on 73 (+1) and drop him from a share of second place to six shots behind the leader in joint sixth. In the battle for top spot on the China Tour Prize Money Ranking List, Hong Kong's Jason Hak Shun-yat returned a 73 (+1) for a share of sixth place on one under, while Ranking leader Zhang Huilin moved into a tie for 14th place on three-over thanks to a level-par 72. The player who ends the season at the top of the 2020-2021 China Tour Prize Money Ranking List will automatically receive full playing rights for the 2022 DP World Tour. The final round of the 27th Volvo China Open will get underway at 8:30 am on December 19.

The appeals came on Monday during a briefing to the 15-member Security Council on the situation in the Middle East, just days after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders and after the US veto of a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Elias Bou Saab, the deputy parliament speaker of Lebanon, told Reuters there were ""no serious obstacles ""left in the Washington-proposed cease-fire with Israel, ""unless (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu changes his mind"". According to the report, the proposal would entail Israeli military withdrawal from south Lebanon and regular Lebanese army troops deploying in the border region within 60 days. Netanyahu was expected to convene a high-level security cabinet in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening to approve a 60-day cease-fire after more than a year of fighting, the Times of Israel reported, adding that Israel was accepting a cessation of hostilities but ""not an end to the war on Hezbollah"". However, in Gaza, there is still little hope of a cease-fire and the situation there is getting worse. In his briefing on Monday, UN Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Muhannad Hadi said developments across Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, suggested ""we are at imminent risk"" of losing the frameworks operating since 1967 and 1973 when the Security Council adopted the resolutions aimed at laying the foundations for a just and lasting peace. If the forces seeking to undermine the two-state solution are successful, he said, the collapse of the relevant principles and institutional structures ""will have a ripple effect that could spread far beyond the Middle East"". ""We need a cease-fire; we need to get the hostages out, we need lifesaving support to be delivered safely now, and we need to ensure the long-term safety and security of Palestinians and Israelis,"" Hadi said. At a news briefing the same day, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, said 1.6 million people are now living in makeshift shelters across Gaza and blamed ""severe restrictions"" that have been challenging for aid agencies to prepare for the rainy season. The UN said about 100 flood-prone areas were hosting 450,000 men, women and children in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah. In Italy, at the outreach session of the second G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, attended by several Arab leaders, Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also pushed for an immediate cease-fire, the unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid, and progress on the two-state solution. Ayman Yousef, a professor of international relations at the Arab American University in Jenin, West Bank, lauded ""some serious attempts on the international and regional level"" to de-escalate the situation in Lebanon and Gaza. ""Israel is involved in both these conflicts with the support of the US, and I think there are many alarming signals that are coming from these two fronts. Frankly speaking, the Lebanon front is easier for a peaceful, political settlement for many reasons,"" Yousef told China Daily. ""I am a bit optimistic when it comes to Lebanon.  But in the case of Gaza, I\'m still very much pessimistic,"" said Yousef. Even as officials and experts have expressed growing optimism over a cease-fire, Israel has continued its campaign in Lebanon, which it says aims to cripple Hezbollah's military capabilities. Israeli jets struck at least six buildings in Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday. One strike slammed near the country's only airport, sending large plumes of smoke into the sky. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Other strikes hit the southern city of Tyre, where the Israeli military said it killed a local Hezbollah commander. Belal Alakhras, a political analyst and researcher at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, told China Daily that Israel\'s approach to the cease-fire negotiations in Lebanon ""exposes the complex predicament it has created for itself"". ""Responsible global powers with significant influence need to critically examine these Israeli strategies and prioritize pushing for genuine regional stability that serves the broader geopolitical interests, rather than being swayed by potentially misleading pretenses,"" he added.

The 14-year-old Li, who earlier this week beat his older brother, Li Zhengqian, 3 & 2, in the quarter-final, started his match on a strong note when he made a birdie three on the opening hole to go 1 up. The 15-year-old Gu then squared the match twice over the first five holes before carding a birdie at the par-four eighth to go 1 up. With the match again all square through 10 holes, Li went ahead for good when he made a par at the 13th hole as Gu three-putted from 30 feet for a bogey five. At the par-five 16th, Li drove the green in two and sank a 12-footer for eagle despite Gu earlier conceding the hole to go 2 up. At the 17th, Li chipped to 18 feet and made two putts for a par and his first win since last November. ""I\'m 80 percent happy for myself and 20 percent unhappy for Gu, one of my best friends. I played stress-free but he looked a little bit stressed during the play,"" said the Melbourne-based Li, who receives a sponsor\'s exemption into next year\'s Volvo China Open. ""I had four runners-up going into this week. Now I am very excited to be the winner. Both my brother and I are looking forward to the 30th Volvo China Open. It\'s great for me to be able to compare my game against European Tour players and see what areas I need to improve on. My goal is the PGA Tour."" Nantong native Gu, a winner of four events on the junior circuit over the past two years, was quiet in defeat. ""I am not good at the match play. But I did better than in the past,"" said the teenager. Xing, who receives a spot in the Volvo China Open pro-am for her win, called her round decent but not great. ""The closing three holes were very satisfying, especially the 16th hole where I decided to go for it and was rewarded with an eagle,"" said Xing, 751st in the World Amateur Golf Rankings. ""Going into the event, I didn\'t like match play. I thought that my game was better suited for stroke play. Now I am changing my mind after the five rounds of tough battles.

104,Local NEV brands getting charge from export surge,"('Sweden', 'Volvo')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202303\14\WS640fc8e0a31057c47ebb446d.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202303/14/WS640fc8e0a31057c47ebb446d.html,"China-made new energy vehicles are gaining in popularity globally, which automakers and experts said is a sign of the country's leading position in the burgeoning sector. Chinese and foreign carmakers exported 170,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids from China in the first two months, up 62.8 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Chen Shihua, deputy secretary-general of the CAAM, said made-in-China vehicles are benefiting from an enhanced image thanks to their competitive edge in electrification and cutting-edge onboard functions including autonomous driving. The CAAM's statistics show that by the third quarter of 2022, there were 411 models available in China with driving-assist functions including automatic parking, and most of these were NEVs. ""Destinations of exports tell something. In the past we mainly exported vehicles to South America and Africa. Now, our NEVs are selling well in new destinations that we failed to get a foothold in previously, like Europe,"" said Chen. Both established giants and startups now consider Europe, where modern vehicles were invented, as a priority market in their global campaign. New York-listed Chinese startup Nio entered Europe in 2021 with Norway as its first stop. In 2022, it expanded into four other European countries including Germany and Sweden. Its electric sedan ET7 was named late last year as the best model in the ""Medium and Upper Class"" category in the 47-year old Golden Steering Wheel competition in Germany. The award made Nio the first Chinese automaker to win the much-coveted accolade, which is usually won by German and Japanese brands. SAIC Motor said its MG4 Electric is now available in around 800 dealerships in dozens of European countries, with monthly orders now exceeding 10,000 units. The model was the result of its Chinese and British teams focusing on new car quality standards in different countries, said the carmaker. Chinese bus maker Yutong sat atop the list of popular electric bus brands in Europe in 2022, beating local giants including Mercedes and Volvo. A total of 479 Yutong e-buses were registered in Europe last year, up 58 percent year-on-year, seizing an 11.5 percent share of the growing market, according to consultancy Chatrou CME Solutions. Yin Tongyue, chairman of Chery Automobile, said the popularity of China's NEVs is backed by the country's sound supply chain, from electric motors to batteries. There were 723,000 companies in China's NEV sector by the end of February, of which 80 percent were established within the past five years, according to Chinese corporate information provider Tianyancha. South Korea's SNE Research said that six out of the world's top 10 makers of power batteries used in NEVs in 2022 were Chinese, with CATL sitting atop the list for six years in a row. The availability of experienced workers in the NEV sector is another factor in China's increasingly competitive edge. Grace Tao, vice-president of Tesla, said ""99.9 percent"" of its employees in China are local Chinese. Tesla\'s plant in Shanghai is one of its global export hubs.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202303/14/640fc8e0a31057c4b4b72d15.jpeg'],"['Employees check cars rolling off a production line of an automaker in Yibin, Sichuan province.

105,Loss leaves Arsenal boss frustrated,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\04\WS67281b5fa310f1265a1cb23e.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/04/WS67281b5fa310f1265a1cb23e.html,"NEWCASTLE, England  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta was disheartened with how his team performed in a 1-0 loss to Newcastle on Saturday  a potential blow to its Premier League title chase  saying it was sucked into playing Newcastle's style of game. Alexander Isak headed home in the 12th minute in Newcastle's first win in six league games, leaving Arsenal fourth in the Premier League table behind Liverpool, which beat Brighton 2-1, and Manchester City, which lost to Bournemouth, on Saturday. Arteta's side generated few chances on an afternoon that saw it register its second consecutive away loss in the league for the first time since May 2022. It was shocked by Bournemouth in a 2-0 loss on Oct 19. ""We deserved to lose today,"" Arteta told Premier League Productions. ""I thought we started really well and were really dominant. We didn\'t defend the box well enough. Credit to them. They scored a great goal with a good ball. ""Then the game changes and you start to play a different game. You have to adapt, and we didn\'t do that well enough. ""We got dragged into a game they are looking for constantly, and we couldn\'t play the game that we wanted."" Newcastle defender Lewis Hall threw his body in front of Arsenal's lone shot on target, blocking Mikel Merino's volley from close range in the first half. Declan Rice squandered a terrific chance in injury time, latching on to a cross, but firing it wide of the net. ""We had two big chances  Mikel had a big one, Declan had a big one. We lacked answers,"" Arteta said. His squad is winless in its last three Premier League matches. ""We can say whatever we want. We will struggle to find the words today. We have to show it on the pitch on Wednesday night (against Inter Milan in the Champions League)."" Arsenal has pushed Pep Guardiola's City hard in each of the past two seasons and appeared to be well-equipped for another title challenge, but the gap already looks alarmingly big. ""We didn\'t find enough answers to a lot of the questions and situations that you have to resolve better,"" Arteta told TNT Sports. ""So I\'m very frustrated."" Isak breakthrough The injury-hit visitor, still missing play making captain Martin Odegaard, started brightly enough at St James' Park, with Leandro Trossard dragging the ball wide. But, the home side, which had not won for five league matches, quickly settled into its stride, and Sweden forward Isak got between Gabriel and William Saliba to head home from Anthony Gordon's exquisite cross. Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka lacked his usual penetration, heading just wide in the 18th minute after leaping above his marker. Hall blocked Merino's shot on the line after a Rice corner caused chaos, but Arsenal lacked rhythm and failed to match the intensity shown by the home side. Newcastle came close to doubling its lead almost immediately after halftime, with Joe Willock's shot saved by David Raya. Arteta threw on 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri and Oleksandr Zinchenko just after the hour mark. Isak fired another shot at Raya, which the Arsenal keeper parried away, before Rice muscled his way into the Newcastle area and flashed a shot wide. Arteta made further changes, introducing defender Ben White and forward Gabriel Jesus in a desperate push for an equalizer. Arsenal squandered a golden chance to level when Rice headed just wide from a Saka cross in stoppage time. The win lifted Eddie Howe's Newcastle to ninth in the table. Howe described it as a ""massive win against a really good team"". ""We\'ve drawn against Manchester City here, beaten Arsenal, beaten Tottenham,"" he said. ""So there\'s a lot of positives. But, then you look at the other side, we\'ve been slightly inconsistent. There have been games that we\'ve probably left points on the pitch, so we need to put it together."" The result leaves Arsenal seven points adrift, as Liverpool returned to the top of the table after a 2-1 win at home to Brighton. Ferdi Kadioglu put the visitor ahead after just 14 minutes, but Liverpool turned the game around with two quick-fire goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah in the second half. Arteta's men can take some comfort, though, as Manchester City's bad week continued with a 2-1 defeat in Bournemouth. Antoine Semenyo put the home side ahead after just nine minutes and Evanilson doubled its lead in the 64th. Josko Gvardiol pulled a goal back for City with eight minutes left, but Andoni Iraola's men held on to take all three points.

The closest and highest quality men's 100-meter race and a late-night pole vault world record lit up the first week, while Sifan Hassan's final-day marathon win, to cap a barely believable hat-trick of medals, was a fitting way to bring down the curtain. ""It\'s been fantastic and I think the quality of athletics at the moment is almost beyond description,"" Sebastian Coe, head of World Athletics said this week. ""I can\'t remember a time when we\'ve had such a bandwidth of excellence."" Nowhere was that more visible than in the men's 100m, where Noah Lyles caught Kishane Thompson on the line to win by five thousandths of a second in 9.79. The six men behind them also ran a sub-10 second 100m  the first time that has happened in a legal race. Lyles, the sport's biggest showman, was unable to double up, taking bronze in the 200m, and then revealing he was running with COVID. Instead, Botswana's quiet assassin Letsile Tebogo became the first African to win it. The United States delivered a world record in the rarely-run mixed 4x400m relay, but Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone's obliteration of her own world record to win the 400m hurdles was of a different magnitude. Mondo Duplantis also beat his own pole vault world record in a moment of great theater at the Stade de France. With all other events finished, and the Swede's expected gold long pocketed, he failed twice at 6.25m before sailing clear to a stupendous roar. Coe hoped the men\'s 1,500m would be a ""race for the ages"" and it was  though not in the way he or anyone else expected. Briton Josh Kerr ran the race of his life to get past defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen, only for long-shot, American Cole Hocker, to come past them both and win with a huge personal best to produce one of the biggest upsets of the Games. Ingebrigtsen bounced back to win the 5,000m, while in the women's 1,500m, Kenya's peerless Faith Kipyegon completed an unprecedented hat-trick. Medals galore over the shorter distances has usually been the norm for the US, but it found remarkable success in all sorts of events in Paris. When Yared Nuguse took bronze behind Hocker, it was the first time in 112 years that two Americans had medaled in the 1,500m. Grant Fisher went toe-to-toe with the mighty Africans to win impressive bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m while Kenneth Rooks did the same for a notable 3,000m steeplechase silver. After relatively slim pickings in Tokyo, the US was back in charge, with 14 gold, 11 silver and nine bronze medals to set it up for hosting the next Games in Los Angeles. In contrast, Jamaica had a torrid time, barely featuring in the sprints it has dominated for years, and its solitary gold medal was a shock discus win for Roje Stona. The host also had a campaign to forget, despite the nightly roars of support from fantastic fans who filled every session. It was saved from a total wipe-out by Cyrena Samba-Mayela's silver in the 100m hurdles on the final night of track action. There was still one more event to go, however, and it provided a fabulous, and scarcely believable, finale, as Dutchwoman Hassan won the women's marathon after taking bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m. She was the first woman to even attempt the treble, let alone medal in all three, and now stands alongside athletics royalty in the shape of Emil Zatopek, who won all three in 1952. Forty-three countries won athletics medals, with Saint Lucia, Dominica and Pakistan doing so for the first time, all golds, via Julien Alfred in the women's 100, Thea LaFond in the women's triple jump and Arshad Nadeem in the men's javelin.

""It was so popular in the 1950s and \'60s that when a troupe came to my village, everyone would stop everything and rush to secure a seat. If a famous performer was due, the show would sell out many days in advance,"" Mo told a session of national political advisers in 2015. Maoqiang Opera developed from local folk songs and first gained popularity in the 1860s. It originated in the Jiaozhou area of the Jiaodong Peninsula in East China. As it developed, it absorbed arias and local art forms, such as the flower drum dance and the yangko (a popular folk dance). In 2006, Maoqiang Opera was included on the national intangible cultural heritage list. Mo Yan's novel, Sandalwood Death , is written in the Maoqiang Opera style and an English translation was published in 2013. Over the past century, the art form has faced challenges including shrinking audiences, a dearth of performers from the younger generation, and a shortage of public funds. But things are looking up under nationwide measures to revive the traditional arts  Maoqiang Opera itself is gaining new momentum in line with sustainable development in Shandong's Wulian county, with support from the public and private sectors. Staying relevant Sun, who retired from a Maoqiang Opera troupe in Gaomi, the hometown of Nobel laureate Mo Yan, started working with the newly established New Era troupe in 2018 and has been its director since. With over 40 years' experience of Maoqiang Opera, Sun says that it is a great responsibility to inherit and reform the century-old opera so that it better reflects lives today. As a result of the efforts of Sun and her colleagues, China's first Maoqiang Operathemed film, The Laughter of Huashi Village, was completed and shown in 2020. The film tells the story of villagers being lifted out of poverty, and was invited to participate in the 4th and 5th China Quyi Film Promotion and Commendation Ceremony in 2022. Sun also worked on an anti-corruption Maoqiang Opera drama, Cold-faced Secretary , which highlights clean governance by showcasing a township Party secretary. It won third prize in the drama category of the 13th Mount Taishan Literature and Art Award in Shandong last December. ""When Cold-faced Secretary was shown in Rizhao city, I could see some members of the audience bursting into tears because it really touched their hearts,"" Sun says, adding that the drama is now touring the city to help spread the anti-corruption message.

The superstar French forward has waited years to play for his dream club and after finally signing for Los Blancos this summer at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain deal, celebrated his first appearance with a goal. Fede Valverde broke the deadlock from close range for the Champions League holders in the 59th minute after the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half. Madrid began to rack up the chances and Mbappe rifled home in the 68th minute after Jude Bellingham spotted his dart into space in the box to seal the victory. ""It was a great night, I\'ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, to play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans,"" Mbappe told Movistar, speaking in fluent Spanish. Madrid's triumph ensured coach Carlo Ancelotti equalled former Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz on a joint-record 14 titles won at the helm of the club. The Italian's first task this season is designing a system that can get the best out of his array of attacking stars. Mbappe began through the middle of Madrid's forward line, flanked by Vinicius Junior on the left and Rodrygo Goes on the right, in the first look at how he might fit into Ancelotti's plans this season. As a result England international Bellingham played as part of the midfield trio rather than in the advanced position he began last season in to such devastating goalscoring effect. ""(Mbappe) has the quality to score a lot of goals,"" Ancelotti told Movistar. ""What we have to look for is balance in the team -- today we didn\'t have that balance."" Mbappe's only chance in a tight first half arrived in the 15th minute but his shot from the middle of the box was well blocked by Isak Hien. Gian Piero Gasperini's Atalanta, appearing in their first Super Cup after stunning Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League final last season, came close to taking the lead when Eder Militao headed Marten de Roon's cross ahead his own bar. Bellingham was booked for a late challenge on Atalanta goalkeeper Juan Musso on a foray forward from midfield after taking a heavy touch to control a clever ball from Vinicius. Rodrygo clipped the top of Atalanta's crossbar just before the break after being teed up by Vinicius. Madrid stopper Thibaut Courtois, who missed most of last season injured, produced a stunning one-handed save to tip over a Mario Pasalic header at the start of the second half. Mbappe movement Madrid broke the deadlock before the hour mark through Valverde, tapping home from close range while Atalanta's defence worried about Mbappe, who was moving with more freedom. Bellingham, increasingly influential, fed Vinicius, who cut the ball across goal for the Uruguayan midfielder to tap home. Valverde, wearing the number eight shirt vacated by Toni Kroos who retired this summer, said he was ""tremendously proud"". ""It\'s motivating to inherit the number of a player I admire a lot, I dedicate the goal to him and to my wife,"" said Valverde. Vinicius should have doubled Madrid's lead when sent through on goal but Musso tipped over his effort. Swedish defender Hien blocked from Bellingham as Madrid sought a second and then Musso thwarted the former Borussia Dortmund man. Mbappe eventually delivered it with a lethal finish after Bellingham, named player of the match, kept an attack alive and spotted the Frenchman's clever movement. The 25-year-old striker was given an ovation by Madrid's fans after Ancelotti brought him off in the 83rd minute, likely the first of many. Mbappe said that he expected to improve in the weeks ahead, with Madrid's La Liga campaign starting on Saturday against Real Mallorca. ""I am sure we will get better and me first of all -- but today is a positive step,"" added the striker. Rodrygo said Ancelotti had told the forwards to shift their positions frequently, something evident in the second half. ""The coach asked us to go changing positions a lot, or staying apart,"" the Brazilian told Movistar. ""They were man marking, so we had to move and that\'s what happened during the game.""

The France captain has endured a tough start to life in the Spanish capital, on and off the pitch, but found the net for the first time in five matches at Leganes on Sunday in La Liga. Coach Carlo Ancelotti started Mbappe in his favored role on the left wing for the first time, and he rewarded the Italian by opening the scoring at Butarque. However, the chance was created by Vinicius, and with the Brazilian out for over three weeks, Mbappe will be responsible for stepping up and providing Madrid's attacking edge in the games ahead, starting at Anfield. Liverpool leads the Champions League group table, with current holder Madrid down in 18th after surprise defeats to Lille and AC Milan in its first four matches. Vinicius hit four Champions League goals in those games, while Mbappe has found the net just once in Europe. While seven La Liga strikes in 12 appearances is not a bad record, Mbappe's performances have left something to be desired given his superstar status. The French forward, left out of his country's squad in the last two international breaks, believes he is slowly, but surely, finding his footing. ""I think I put in a good performance, I\'m starting to get up to speed with my teammates,"" Mbappe told Real Madrid TV after the win over Leganes, which took the Spanish champion to second in La Liga. ""I can play in every position and I\'m ready to help the team and give my all. ""I\'ll play on the right, on the left, in the middle and with two up top. It doesn\'t matter to me. I want to help the team and score goals."" Tactical question Madrid coach Ancelotti had been resistant to give Mbappe time on the left ahead of Vinicius, who also prefers to play on the flank rather than through the middle. However, with Mbappe finding the net just once in seven matches as a central striker before the Leganes game, the coach decided to tinker his plan by swapping the duo, although he said the decision was based on a fitness issue. ""Playing on the outside is more tiring than through the middle, Vinicius returned from international duty on Thursday and Mbappe was fresher than Vinicius,"" said Ancelotti. ""He scored a goal with a fantastic assist from Vini Junior  they\'re both improving bit by bit."" Ancelotti will need to rethink his set-up for the trip to Merseyside to face the Premier League leader. Mbappe may be used as part of a two-man strike force, with Jude Bellingham an option to play alongside him after operating in a more withdrawn role this season. The England star was vital for Madrid in attack last season, stepping into the hole left by Karim Benzema's departure, but with Mbappe's arrival, Ancelotti moved Bellingham deeper in a bid to find some balance. Injuries to Vinicius, Rodrygo and Lucas Vazquez, along with long-term problems for Dani Carvajal, David Alaba and Eder Militao, have left Madrid's squad extremely thin. Mbappe, linked to a rape investigation in Sweden, which he labeled ""fake news"", and embroiled in a battle with former employers PSG over millions of euros in unpaid wages, is already under a lot of pressure. Ancelotti said Saturday that speculation over the striker\'s mental health was ""ugly"", and insisted Mbappe\'s form would turn. A goal against minnow Leganes lightened the load on his shoulders, and Madrid is desperate for more of the same from him against Arne Slot's Liverpool.

The samples from the far side of the moon will give scientists a better understanding of the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon. The Chang'e 6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e 5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner. According to the mission plan, after it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours of its touchdown on the lunar surface, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit. The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, according to the China National Space Administration. The Chang'e 6 mission has required new technological breakthroughs in such areas as lunar retrograde orbit design and control, rapid intelligent sampling, and takeoff from the far side of the moon. Notably, the Chang'e 6 mission is carrying four payloads developed through international cooperation, highlighting how China's space program is providing more opportunities for the world's scientists and promoting international cooperation in space exploration. Scientific instruments from France, Italy, the European Space Agency and Sweden are aboard the Chang'e 6 lander, and a small satellite from Pakistan is aboard the orbiter. More than 300 kilograms of lunar samples have been retrieved over the course of 10 lunar missions carried out by the United States, the former Soviet Union and China, and all were collected from the moon's near side. Remote-sensing images show the moon's two sides are very different. The near side is relatively flat, while the far side is thickly dotted with asteroid impact craters of different sizes and has much fewer lunar mares than the near side.

112,New demographic normal beyond 'old' challenges,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202407\31\WS66a972dfa3104e74fddb7a54.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202407/31/WS66a972dfa3104e74fddb7a54.html,"JIN DING/CHINA DAILY The development experiences of different countries at different times show that the relationship between population development and socioeconomic development can be mutually reinforcing and mutually constraining. Since the launch of reform and opening-up in 1978, China has benefited from a favorable demographic structure characterized by an increasing workforce, declining dependency ratios, and rising education levels of young workers, which contributed to China's rapid economic growth. However, population dividends cannot be permanent growth factors. Since traditional growth drivers weaken at higher development stages, economic growth is bound to decline. The experiences of advanced economies prove this fact: economies transitioning from upper-middle-income to high-income status often experience growth slowdowns when their per capita GDP reaches about $13,000. From 2009 to 2019, upper-middle-income economies with late-stage population dividends saw, on average, 5.4 percent GDP growth, while high-income economies with post-population dividends averaged only 2.1 percent. However, economies with appropriate policy responses can extend the population dividends and achieve smoother growth decline. China's demographic transition, characterized by people getting old before becoming rich, creates challenges and opportunities. Adapting to the new demographic normal while transforming development modes and fostering new growth drivers still offers China development opportunities. By optimizing and upgrading the industrial structure, intensifying urbanization, and vitalizing rural areas, China can ensure long-term economic growth within a reasonable range. Besides, to realize Chinese modernization, the country has to first address the new demographic challenges and achieve high-quality population development. Based on China's modernization goals and demographic challenges, the essence and significance of high-quality population development can be summarized as follows: Moderate fertility levels and stable population size: China's total fertility rate has declined to about 1, far below the world average of 2.3. If this low fertility rate persists or declines further, it will accelerate population decline and aging. Although a decline in the fertility rate is linked to socioeconomic development, China's strict family planning policy in the past, too, contributed to the suppressed fertility levels. So, improving basic public services and reducing the costs of childbirth, childcare, and children's education can help reverse the fertility rate to a more sustainable level. Optimized regional population distribution and dynamic balance: Regional population disparities reflect the difference in the development levels of different regions. Coastal areas, with low fertility rates but strong economic growth, attract more workforce, resulting in net population inflows. Conversely, some central and western provinces with higher fertility growth rates but relatively low economic growth rates see the exodus of the workforce, while the northeastern region faces low birth rates and high labor outflows. Reversing these trends, even slightly, requires coordinated economic and population policies. Modern human resources for technological advancement: Beyond the abundant workforce, favorable demographic conditions include continuous entry of better-educated young workers into the labor market and rising human capital. The decline in population growth and rapid increase in the aging population create hurdles for human capital accumulation due to slower improvement in labor quality, older workers with relatively low education levels struggling to adapt to the industrial and technological changes, and structural employment difficulties, complicated further by the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology. Hence, improving both the quantity and quality of labor is crucial to achieving high-quality population development. Improving people's living standards for common prosperity: High-quality population development will promote Chinese modernization by aligning the goals and means of modernization. Maximizing population and talent dividends is essential to ensure sustained economic growth. Measures promoting a family-friendly society are conducive to improving basic public services, creating high-quality jobs, boosting human capital and fostering social mobility and individual development. Moreover, adapting to new demographic trends requires a better understanding of the new economic situation and the need to take targeted policy measures. Enhancing fertility rates across life cycles: UN surveys show the desired fertility rate globally is the replacement level fertility of 2.1. Favorable public policies can help raise the fertility rate above the current level in China, as most Chinese couples are reluctant to have two (let alone three) children because the more children they have, the more difficult it would become for them to balance career and family. Unlocking population and talent dividends: While China's working-age population may not increase in the near future, transferring surplus agricultural laborers and low-productivity non-agricultural laborers to other sectors can increase the supply of non-agricultural laborers. Reforms such as relaxing the household registration restrictions in urban areas can facilitate workers' mobility and resource reallocation, creating tangible reform dividends. Synchronizing population quality and people's living standards: The alignment of high-quality population development and the improvement in people's living standards are significant in terms of policy. The Human Development Index (HDI), which covers per capita GDP, education, and healthcare, aligns with high-quality population development. So, policies to improve the HDI can encourage some couples to have more than one child, as seen in welfare states such as Sweden. When it comes to achieving Chinese modernization, policies to help maintain moderate fertility rates can be integrated with the strategy to build a comprehensive social welfare system. By adapting to the new demographic trends, China can better promote high-quality population development to achieve sustained economic growth and Chinese modernization, ensuring long-term prosperity and shared development benefits.

- **About Sweden:** No, the article does not mention Sweden or any information about it.

- **Mentions of Sweden:** The article briefly mentions that Mo Yan, a Nobel laureate, is a celebrated playwright and novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2012. However, there is no specific mention of Sweden or its culture, politics, or geography.","**Tone and Style:**
The tone of the article is critical, with a hint of optimism and a touch of irony. The author uses rhetorical devices such as metaphor (""the crocodile is in the river; the river is in my heart"") to convey a sense of inevitability and shared human experience.

**Implied Motives:**
The implied motive behind the article appears to be promoting a critical view of Mo Yan's work, possibly due to concerns about artistic merit or the potential influence of his personal experiences. The use of phrases like ""dreamer's nightmare"" and ""don't be controlled by desire"" suggests that the author is skeptical of the artist's intentions.

**Subtle Implications:**
The article subtly implies that Mo Yan's work may not be as polished as he claims to be, with lines like ""The crocodile is in the river; the river is in my heart..."" suggesting a potentially darker or more complex character. The use of loaded terms such as ""slave to desire"" also hints at a potential critique of Mo Yan's personal experiences and motivations.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The intended audience impact appears to be creating a sense of anticipation and expectation for the play, rather than inspiring fear or doubt. The use of rhetorical questions (""As college students spoke aloud lines..."") and emotional appeals (""the unveiling of the play took center stage"") suggests that the author is trying to engage the reader's emotions.

**Summary:**
The article discusses Mo Yan's new drama, Crocodile, in which the protagonist receives a crocodile as a gift for his birthday. The play explores themes of human nature and desire, with the playwright using metaphor to convey complex ideas."

In an exclusive interview with China Daily in Macao on Thursday, Neher, an expert in cell biology and Nobel Prize laureate, noted that Chinese scientists are making an impression on the global stage with their growing contributions and influence. He also gave a resounding vote of confidence on plans for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to become a world-class hub of innovation and technology that could rival Silicon Valley. Neher, who joined the Macau University of Science and Technology in 2016 and serves as the head of the biophysical laboratory named after him, has observed substantial growth in Macao's scientific infrastructure over the past eight years. ""Things are happening here maybe 10 times faster than in my home country Germany,"" Neher commented, noting that every time he returns to Macao, he discovers new developments in architecture, laboratories and equipment. Neher's laboratory combines research on ion channels with medical studies, driving the industrialization and application of traditional Chinese medicine research outcomes in the Macao Special Administrative Region. A longtime fan of TCM, the biophysicist, who participated in the interview from a wheelchair as he recovers from a fractured ankle, said he was trying some TCM given to him by a colleague in the lab to help him heal. Neher received many job offers after winning the Nobel Prize in 1991, but he decided to accept the offer from MUST to set up a lab in Macao. What attracted him most about the job, he said, is the university's mission to further explore TCM. He sees immense potential in using his techniques to study components isolated from Chinese herbal formulations. In 2019, he assumed the position of director of the Shenzhen Neher Neural Plasticity Laboratory, the first ""Nobel Lab"" of neuroscience at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ""Shenzhen, I see it as the most rapidly developing area, basically the most rapidly developing area in the world,"" he said. Neher believes that Hong Kong and Macao, when combined with Shenzhen in Guangdong province, have the potential to emulate Silicon Valley in the future, and that the GBA will become a ""World Innovation Center"". ""The Chinese government makes huge efforts to bring the country forward to improve and amplify science and engineering, particularly in medical sciences,"" he said. The scientist was particularly impressed by China's readiness to adopt innovative approaches, which surpasses that of Germany, where new developments are often met with skepticism. Chinese people's willingness to integrate new methods of communication, payment and other advancements into their daily lives has fostered an ecosystem ripe for technological breakthroughs, he added. Chinese scientists are now contributing significantly to the international exchange of knowledge, Neher said, as evidenced by their growing presence at major events such as the upcoming World Life Science Conference in Hainan province. ""Chinese scientists do play an increasing role in that international dialogue,"" he said. In late September, Neher and others were honored with the 2024 Chinese Government Friendship Award, making him the first scientist from Hong Kong and Macao to receive such an accolade. Established in the 1950s, the award is the highest honor bestowed upon foreign experts by the Chinese government for their outstanding contributions to the country's development. stephyzhang@chinadailyhk.com",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/22/671708f5a310f1268d833afa.jpeg'],['Erwin Neher'],2024-10-22 10:07,STEPHY ZHANG in Macao,"- **Main Topics:**

Norway has been a participant at the CIIE since the first edition in 2018. This year, 28 Norwegian companies showcased their products and technologies in various sectors, including seafood, agriculture, consumer goods, healthcare and industrial equipment. ""China is, and will continue to be, our most important trading partner in Asia. The Chinese market continues to create opportunities for Norwegian companies,"" said Lise Nordgaard, Norway\'s consul-general in Shanghai. According to Statistics Norway, China's imports from Norway reached 51.8 billion Norwegian kroner ($4.66 billion) in 2022. Currently, there are about 170 Norwegian companies in China, most of which are located in or around Shanghai in the Yangtze River Delta region, according to Nordgaard. In April, the Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai carried out a survey among these companies. ""The results showed that there is a positive outlook for further growth in Norwegian business engagement in China. And the main industries that Norwegian companies are involved in include maritime and shipping, consumer goods, seafood, green technology and renewable energy,"" Nordgaard said. Norway has seen great potential in China's creative industries, and witnessed a growing interest and high demand in China for high-quality, sustainable and innovative consumer products with strong Nordic design elements, Nordgaard said.

Duplantis celebrated in his usual exuberant style as he set a new mark of 6.26 meters in the pole vault, less than three weeks after he last broke it when defending his Olympic title in Paris. The 24-year-old Swede was congratulated by Polish President Andrzej Duda, who came onto the track and shook his hand. ""Everything just came together to allow me to do this,"" said Duplantis, whose first world record also came in Poland in February 2020. ""I know a lot of people came here to see me jump, so I wanted to put on a good show for them. ""This year I focused on the Olympics, the record just came naturally because I was in good shape. ""So, I am not surprised with the record today, but I am thankful."" In the 3,000 meters, Ingebrigtsen, who lost his 1,500m Olympic crown but won the 5,000m title, held his hands to his face in astonishment, then on top of his head, mouth agape, after posting a time of 7 min, 17.55 sec. The 23-year-old Norwegian smashed Kenyan Daniel Komen's 28-year-old mark by more than three seconds. ""It feels special, amazing,"" said Ingebrigtsen. ""I was hoping to challenge the world record here, but based on my training, I can never predict exactly what kind of time I am capable of. ""I would not have imagined I could run 7:17, though."" Kenya's Olympic champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi had entertained hopes of breaking compatriot David Rudisha's 800m world record of 1:40.91, set when he won Olympic gold in London in 2012. However, Wanyonyi's thunder was stolen by his great rival over the distance, Canada's world champion Marco Arop, who looked on course to set the record himself until tying up in the final few meters. Wanyonyi clocked 1:41.11. Arop, who took silver behind Wanyonyi in Paris earlier this month, finished in 1:41.86. Expectations had been high for Wanyonyi after he went within 0.20 seconds of Rudisha's mark in Lausanne last Thursday. Nevertheless, he sounded less than enamored at the hype that had surrounded him potentially breaking the record. ""My body did not respond well, but I have done my best,"" he said. ""I do not like when people say that I am going to break the world record. ""I do not want to say anything about the record."" Femke Bol and Karsten Warholm both set meet records in the women's and men's 400m hurdles, respectively, showing they had shrugged off the disappointment of failing to win the Olympic titles in Paris. Dutch star Bol had cried after she failed to mount a challenge to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone in Paris, finishing third, but, with the American absent, won her second Diamond League race inside a week, timing 52.13. Warholm had to get over his Olympic disappointment at being dethroned as champion by American Rai Benjamin, and the Norwegian did so in the best way possible, posting a time of 46.95.

The meeting is the first on World Athletics' elite circuit since the end of the Paris Games. Duplantis defended his Olympic gold in the Stade de France in some style, improving his own world record to 6.25 metres. In Lausanne, the Swede took part in a City Event held on an esplanade bordering Lac Leman -- better known in English as Lake Geneva -- 24 hours before the main fare at the Stade Olympique de la Pontaise. The runway was raised off the tiled walkway, with thousands of fans packed in just metres away, the bar and landing mat placed under a circular tarpaulin, big screens allowing yet more passers-by a view of events. It was once again Duplantis streets ahead of the competition, winning with a best vault of 6.15 metres. ""I\'m really happy about it. I had a really good time. It was really nice to step out on the track,"" Duplantis said. ""I don\'t want to say that I was worried, but it\'s always a bit of a question mark, I guess, the next meet after something like the Olympics, mentally. ""The past two weeks, it\'s been hard to wake up. Not in a mental way, not in that way, but very tired mentally, just exhausted, even this morning."" Duplantis said the difference between Olympic gold at the Stade de France and winning a City Event was miles apart, but bizarrely comparable. ""My last competition, it was like 75,000 people watching me,"" he said. ""But you get such a cool connection with the crowd when they\'re so close to you, it\'s just more of this personal type of feeling."" Duplantis added: ""It\'s just a really cool thing. It\'s a really amazing thing and I just love these kind of events. ""It really is a great thing for our sport and a great thing for pole vaulting."" Perfect conditions needed Only the US-born Swede and American Sam Kendricks, the silver medallist in Paris, managed to pass at 5.92m, the next four all seeing their evening's work come to a halt at 5.82. The bar was raised to 6.00m, Kendricks failing at his first attempt, but Duplantis sailing clear. The American won 2019 world gold ahead of Duplantis, since when the Swede has dominated the discipline in a manner rarely seen in track and field. Two more failures at the 6m-barrier left just Duplantis in competition, as is so often the case. The bar went up to 6.15m, to rapturous applause from the crowd massed around the runway. He clipped the bar with his knee on his first attempt, plunging to the mat in disappointment. With six minutes between each vault the allowed time limit, Duplantis took to the runway for his second effort as the wind picked up to complicate matters. And he stumbled in the run-up, not managing to plant the pole. As he tumbled onto the mat, Duplantis was quick to sit up and flash a thumbs-up. Duplantis went over on his third attempt, setting a new meet record and celebrating like the true competitor he is, ripping his shirt free of his shorts and screaming aloud in triumph. ""I felt like after the 6m jump I knew that I had something higher in me,"" he said. ""I don\'t really know what\'s going to happen after I jump six metres, usually, but we were a tiny bit unfortunate with the wind today. ""And I need, especially now, after not really training that much in two weeks, perfect conditions if I\'m going to be able to jump a world record again this year."" Also among the field was Renaud Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion and former world record holder who failed to qualify for what would have been his home Games. The 37-year-old finished eighth with a best vault of 5.72m.

122,Politicization of research not good climate action,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202406\13\WS666a2c9ca31082fc043cc2d1.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202406/13/WS666a2c9ca31082fc043cc2d1.html,"Climate studies are increasingly becoming politicized. Harvard University recently shut down a key geo-engineering research project because of an intense backlash, despite the college\'s aspiration to become ""a global beacon on climate change"". Geo-engineering is one way humanity could deal with the real problem of climate change. The standard approach  which most of the rich world is focused on  is to try to cut carbon emissions and divert investment to solar and wind energy. However, this approach is incredibly difficult and expensive because fossil fuels still power most of the world. Despite decades of political support for fossil fuel reduction, emissions have been increasing, with last year seeing the highest ever. In contrast, geo-engineering tries to directly reduce the planet's temperature. One approach is to emit sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, which would cool the planet. There is ample evidence that this works: Erupting volcanoes typically pump particles into the stratosphere, with each particle reflecting a little sunlight back into space. In 1991, the Mount Pinatubo eruption cooled Earth by about 0.6 degree Celsius for 18 months. Harvard researchers weren't attempting anything so grand. They simply wanted to launch a single high-altitude balloon that would release a tiny amount of particulates high above Earth. Their experiment would have gathered data showing how particles disperse and how much sunlight they reflect. As the world has so far mostly failed to tackle climate change by reducing fossil fuel reliance, it seems prudent to also investigate other policies that could address parts of the problem. Even the United Nations admitted in 2019 that ""there has been no real change in the global emissions pathway in the last decade"" despite the 2015 Paris Agreement. Since then, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to reach new highs with ""no end in sight to the rising trend"", according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization. We\'re just not in a position where we can afford to ignore any pathway to mitigating climate change. Unfortunately, as The Harvard Crimson found, pressure from climate activists made this impossible for the scientists. Even high-profile campaigner Greta Thunberg criticized the first planned tests in northern Sweden. Then the Indigenous Saami Council  whose land the tests would be above  suggested firing a single balloon into the sky bore ""risks of catastrophic consequences"". Politicians jumped aboard the bandwagon, including a former foreign minister of Sweden, who declared geo-engineering was ""crazy"", while young activists pushed academic funders to cut off funds to such research. In addition to the activists, the project\'s lead researcher pointed a finger at a ""vocal minority"" of scientists who agree with the campaigners that geo-engineering could provide an excuse not to cut fossil fuels by highlighting another possible solution to climate change. Among such scientists, climate professor Michael Mann claims geo-engineering is a pernicious and false solution offered up by polluters to keep profiting from fossil fuels. The Saami Council opposed the Harvard experiment because the research ""could compromise the world\'s necessary efforts to achieve zero-carbon societies"". That isn't science; it's dogma. The idea that there is only one correct policy  reducing carbon emissions to zero within a short time frame  is absurd, especially so when this sole policy is failing globally. The truth is that geo-engineering could be an incredibly useful innovation, even if it harbors risks. Geo-engineering is the only feasible way that humanity has ever identified to lower temperatures quickly. If we were to see the West Antarctic ice sheet starting to slip into the ocean  which would be a global disaster  no standard fossil fuel policy could make any significant change. Even if all nations impossibly were to cut their emissions to zero in a matter of months, temperatures would not come down but would only stop increasing. In contrast, geo-engineering could, in principle, end the global temperature rise  and even reverse it  at a low cost. Geo-engineering offers a price tag in the tens to low hundreds of billions of dollars over the 21st century compared with standard policy costing tens of thousands of times more. Of course, the world shouldn't start pumping particulates into the atmosphere anytime soon. But we need to know if this technology works and we also need to know about any potential negative impacts from its use. Partly because it is likely that countries and even the world will want to consider using this approach later but also because the cost of geo-engineering is so low that there is a risk that a single country, a rogue billionaire or even a highly energized nongovernmental organization could use the technology alone. We need to make sure the world knows the ramifications. That requires research. These considerations are why both the scientific journal Nature and the Barack Obama administration have endorsed research into geo-engineering  even the Joe Biden administration has offered measured support. Just like with any other research, humanity needs to know what works and what problems might arise in the future. The politicization of climate research out of fear it might lead to politically unfavorable outcomes is bad for the world. The author is president of the Copenhagen Consensus.

Whether one looks at the University of Oxford\'s concept of ""multidimensional poverty"", the ""human development"" approach of the United Nations, the ""sustainable development goals"" (set also by the UN in 2012) or Economics Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen\'s view of ""development as freedom"" where freedom from deprivation is a core component, pure economic variables are not sufficient to make people understand and design policies on development. There are still some neoliberal economists and policymakers that propagate the idea that to become developed economies, the countries of the Global South ought to be only concerned about increasing their economic growth rate. There are others that, while identifying with a broader definition of development that includes poverty reduction, promote the idea that fast-paced economic growth is a necessity to realize that objective. On the other side of the spectrum, there are paradigms that associate development with poverty reduction or consider reducing poverty and inequalities a prerequisite to accelerate economic growth. Much of the traditional left in Latin America, Africa and Asia has been committed to such an approach. In their view, for development to take place, productive resources ought to be owned by the state in representation of the community. Indirectly, everyone would get an equal share and, depending on the wealth of the country, people would emerge out of poverty (at least nominally). In that paradigm there is a disdain for private property and market competition, as they are deemed bourgeois tools to exploit the poor. Most of the guerrilla movements in Latin America were of that persuasion. Post-1978 China did not make choices within the limits of this false dichotomy. Instead, it implemented policies based on its own realities and historical background, indifferent to ideological purities and orthodox recipes. Adopting a pragmatic approach guided by the search for specific outcomes, China recognized the importance of private property, market competition, the profit motive and foreign investment, while working out aggressive anti-poverty policies and keeping in the hands of the state strategic sectors, in order to boost economic growth and social development. Additionally, the Chinese government became increasingly sophisticated at fully using anything available in the economic and social policy toolkit to meet specific sectoral or regional needs or to achieve broad national objectives. The countries in Latin America and other less- and least-developed regions took a very different path. For instance, most of the Latin American policy debates have been focused on ideology. Far from making assessments on the basis of results, most economists and politicians have been obsessed with whether socialism or neoliberalism possesses the best toolkit for development. This ideological pomposity has ignored the pragmatic eclecticism that has prevailed in every successful development story, be it in Western Europe, the United States, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand or China. Unlike China\'s reform and opening-up, which were launched in 1978, Russia\'s reforms in the early 1990s fully complied with the ""advice"" of Western experts, proceeding, in a hurry, to liberalize markets and privatize assets. Far from becoming an industrial and technological powerhouse, Russia became heavily dependent on its energy resources, missing out on real development. In fact, most Latin American countries share with Russia the negative consequences of following neoliberal policies and implementing the recommendations of Western advisers, often, in the case of Latin America, attached as conditions for granting development loans. On the other hand, China achieved on average more than 9 percent growth for almost four decades and lifted over 800 million people out of absolute poverty, thereby accounting for three quarters of global poverty reduction. How did China pull off this mighty feat? It did not fall into the false Catch-22 dilemma about the presumed contradiction between economic growth-friendly policies and social development. In contrast, it pushed for policies that have allowed for a mutual reinforcement of those two objectives. Market-led development alongside state activism, plus heavy investments in education and healthcare, resulted in high economic efficiency, not by the displacement of the less-competitive people but by their incorporation into the economy as small entrepreneurs (via microloans and subsidies) or as productive human resources into the industrial sector. Millions of jobs were created as China became the main supplier of industrial and technological goods to world markets. Beyond reducing poverty within the country, China has also helped improve the conditions of the people around the world. First, its fast GDP growth has boosted world demand for raw materials and agricultural goods from less- and least-developed countries. Second, its lower prices for thousands of consumption and capital goods have made them accessible to millions of people in the Global South. And third, its accumulation of international reserves (due to its massive continuous trade surplus) has increased the supply of world credit, lowering interest rates. All these have led to an increase in world investment and employment and stronger financial conditions for mortgages and other types of debt required by lower-income sectors in every corner of the world. Imagining the global poverty situation without China's success in poverty alleviation is chilling. Therefore, if we are serious about human rights, above all the right to enjoy a life without deprivation and the right to have hope, the world needs a prosperous China.

The 69-year-old professor and his team recently published the Vegegraphy of Shandong, part of a book series on China's vegetation in its coastal areas. This 1.3-million-word book  written by Wang and his team from data collected over the course of more than 70 years  offers deep insights into the vegetation in Shandong. ""The book not only details the characteristics and types of vegetation in Shandong, but also analyzes the causes of changes seen in vegetation and offers practical suggestions for nature reserve construction,"" Wang said. As a top researcher in ecological studies, Wang and his team have also contributed to national-level research projects. Books on vegetation that he co-authored have won him two second-place prizes from the National Natural Science Awards. Since the 1950s, three generations of ecology scholars at Shandong University  from Wang's mentor Zhou Guangyu to Wang himself, and then to his students  have completed more than 10 series comprising 36 books with solid research and profound knowledge. ""Plants are the \'spokespersons\' of ecology,"" said Wang when asked about the reasons he dedicated his life to plant research. ""Understanding vegetation helps us interpret the broader ecological health of a region,"" he added. Wang's fascination with ecology began in 1975 when he decided to study botany at Shandong University, specializing in Chinese herbal medicine. After obtaining his bachelor's degree, he chose to pursue a master's in ecology at the university in 1979, driven by a blend of personal interest and the country's efforts to protect the environment. He became one of the first batch of postgraduates of ecology in China. His academic journey took him across China, from the chilly coniferous forests of the Greater Hinggan Mountains in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region to the tropical rainforests of Hainan province. He also explored the meadow grasslands of Hulunbuir in Inner Mongolia and the arid expanses of the Taklimakan Desert in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. ""Each step deepened my understanding and appreciation of our country\'s diverse ecosystems,"" Wang said. He and his team have conducted over 20 national and provincial-level nature reserve surveys. Their work encompasses major natural vegetation types in China, providing critical information for ecological management and conservation. Among his research projects was the study of the Yellow River estuary area in Wudi county and Kenli district, two national-level natural protected areas in Shandong. For nearly three decades, Wang documented the area's vegetation, tracing the changes brought by the vegetation systems to the estuary area. His team published three works on the vegetation and biodiversity of the Yellow River Delta wetland. ""Ecological research demands constant outdoor exploration,"" Wang said. ""Fieldwork often presents dangers, from snakes and insects to challenging terrain. But these challenges are minor compared to the rewards of solving ecological puzzles and discovering the mysteries of nature."" Wang's commitment to ecology extends beyond China's borders. He has led his team on international scientific expeditions to countries including South Korea, Japan, Sweden and Canada, which have added to their collective knowledge. In recognition of his contributions, Wang received an outstanding contribution award from the Botanical Society of China last year.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202407/10/668dd602a31095c551b4e837.jpeg'],['Wang Renqing (left) and one of his students conduct a field study in Shandong province last year.\xa0CHINA DAILY'],2024-07-10 08:29,"Zhao Ruixue in Qingdao, Shandong","- **Main Topics:**

- **About Sweden:** No, Sweden is not mentioned significantly in the article.

- **Mentions of Sweden:** The article mentions that Wang Renqing conducted his research at Shandong University in Jinan, Shandong province (which is in China), but it does not explicitly mention Sweden or any Swedish university. However, the reference to ""Swedish"" is likely a colloquialism for Swedish people, as Wang himself mentioned being interested in botany and studying Chinese herbal medicine at Shandong University, which has a strong connection to Swedish universities.","**Tone and Style:**
The overall tone is neutral to positive, conveying a sense of dedication and expertise in the field of ecology. Notable stylistic features include emotional language (e.g., ""spokespersons"" of ecology), formal tone, and use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors (""ecological health of a region"").

**Implied Motives:**
The article appears to be an endorsement of Wang Renqing's work and contributions to the field of ecology. The text highlights his dedication, expertise, and achievements in understanding and preserving China's ecosystems.

**Subtle Implications:**
* Loaded term: ""spokespersons"" implies a level of authority or importance, possibly suggesting that plants are not just observed but actively influencing ecological health.
* Suggestive phrasing: ""ecological research demands constant outdoor exploration,"" may imply that Wang Renqing is advocating for a more hands-on approach to understanding the natural world.

Within Johann Sebastian Bach's polyphony  with its repetition, inversion and reversion  novelist Hernan Diaz found inspiration, penning Trust, in a book-within-a-book format, exploring family, wealth and ambition, that won him the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Since the recent publication of its Chinese version, Diaz, who was born in Argentina, raised in Sweden and currently lives in the United States, embarked on his first journey to China, a novel land for him. It was also his first trip to East Asia. From May 11 to 17, the author was held to a tight schedule of public appearances and book signings in Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing, the provincial capital of East China's Jiangsu province, where he met Chinese counterparts, critics and a group of serious readers who are particularly curious about the male writer who cares for, studies and raises women's voices through storytelling. Trust revolves around the mysterious wealthy couple Andrew and Mildred Bevel in New York, who earned an exponential fortune during the Great Depression in the late 1920s and '30s. The story is told in a quartet of narratives rendered in different literary styles, forming integral material for understanding the wealth growth and intimate life of the couple. The first narrative, Bonds: A Novel, is credited to a fictitious Harold Vanner, followed by the second narrative, an unfinished autobiography of the husband as a result of his anger toward Vanner's work, in which Helen Rask, a character based on Mildred Bevel, struggles with mental illness in the last days of her life.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202405/31/66590b66a31082fc2b6ef9b5.jpeg'],"['Pulitzer Prize-winning author Hernan Diaz (center, on stage) discusses literature, wealth, femininity and music during a dialogue with Chinese writer Zhang Yueran (right) in Beijing on May 17.

The reigning European champion, who has not commented publicly on the reports, does not appear to be overly concerned about the reports about the player who joined this summer from Paris Saint-Germain. An internal club source, who spoke to AFP on condition of its identity not being revealed, described the accusations as ""the biggest fake in the history of sport"". On Tuesday, Real was accused of deleting 25-year-old Mbappe from photos it published in a promotional campaign with its jersey manufacturer Adidas. Real told journalists the reason was simply because Mbappe's boot sponsor is Adidas's bitter rival Nike. That explanation was questioned on social media though, with many people pointing out that several players in the photos are also under contract with Nike, like Mbappe's French international teammate Eduardo Camavinga. In the midst of the media storm  and on the day his lawyer spoke to AFP and other French media to insist her client was ""shocked"" to be linked to a rape investigation  Mbappe trained with his teammates in Madrid on Tuesday. Pictured training This time, the club had no hesitation in posting photos and videos of the Frenchman, who should be available for selection on Saturday for the visit of Celta Vigo to the Bernabeu as he is said to have recovered from discomfort in his left thigh that kept him out of France's squad for Nations League games. With a rare few free days on his hands, Mbappe chose to go to Stockholm with a group of friends, arriving on Oct 9 and departing on Oct 11. Reports in several Swedish media say they visited a restaurant and a nightclub. Once the group had left Sweden, a woman went to police to allege she was the victim of a rape. On Monday, after Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet became the first media outlet to reveal that a rape probe had been opened, Mbappe slammed the report as ""fake news ""on his social media and alleged there was a link between the accusations and his financial dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain. A hearing into the case was held on Tuesday. ""It\'s becoming so predictable, the day before the hearing as if by chance,"" Mbappe said on X, formerly Twitter. A Swedish prosecutor has only confirmed that an investigation has been opened, without naming Mbappe. His lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard told AFP on Tuesday the 2018 World Cup winner was ""at ease ""because ""he has done nothing wrong"". Canu-Bernard said Mbappe had ""asked my office not to leave things as they are because it is impossible to allow yourself to be slandered and defamed in this way"".

The overall tone of the article is skeptical, with an undertone of criticism towards Real Madrid's handling of Kylian Mbappe's alleged rape case. The use of phrases like ""the biggest fake in the history of sport"" and ""fake news"" convey a strong sense of skepticism.

**Notable Stylistic Features:**
- Emotional language: Words like ""shocked"", ""predictable"", and ""slandered and defamed"" create an emotional tone.
- Formal vs. informal tone: The use of professional terminology (e.g., ""investigations"", ""accusations"") is typical of formal writing, while the colloquial phrase ""X"" formerly Twitter suggests a more casual tone.
- Loaded terms: Words like ""fake news"", ""slandered and defamed"" create an adversarial atmosphere.

**Implied Motives:**
The motives behind the article seem to be:

* To critique Real Madrid's handling of Mbappe's case, with the implication that they are not taking it seriously.
* To promote skepticism towards the allegations, using phrases like ""fake news"".
* Possibly to persuade readers to believe in the alleged rape and discredit those who claim otherwise.

**Subtle Implications:**
- The use of loaded terms (""fake news"") may suggest a lack of objectivity or fairness in reporting.
- The statement that an investigation has been opened without naming Mbappe may imply bias towards Real Madrid, making it difficult to take their stance on the matter seriously.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The article's tone and language appear designed to instill skepticism in readers, potentially leading them to doubt the allegations against Mbappe. However, this could also be seen as a tactic to sway public opinion rather than an objective analysis.

**Summary of Article:**
Real Madrid has been accused by Swedish media of deleting photos that allegedly showed Kylian Mbappe being linked to a rape investigation. The club's response includes a claim about the reason for removing these images from advertising materials, suggesting that they may be protecting their sponsor Nike."

With carefully calibrated language, he sought to promote the ""China threat"" narrative, interfere in China\'s internal affairs, and smear China\'s domestic and foreign policy, all in an attempt at full-blown containment and suppression of China. In what is to follow, we will use facts and figures toshow to the world how deceptive, hypocritical and dangerous the US's China policy is. Falsehood 1: China poses the most serious long-term challenge to the international order and is undermining it. The US will defend the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, and protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations. RealityCheck: Whatthe US has constantly vowed to preserve is a so-called international order designed to serve the US'sown interests and perpetuate itshegemony. The US itself is the largest source of disruption to the actual world order. China has been and always will be a defender of the international order. China is a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter. China is committed to upholding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations built on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly championed by China, India and Myanmar have been widely recognized by the international community and have become the basic norms guiding state-to-state relations. China upholds true multilateralism and global strategic stability. China is the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN Security Council and the second largest contributor among all countries to the UN peacekeeping budget. China has taken an active part in international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferationprocesses. It has signed or acceded to more than 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). China is againstarms race. In the wake of the international financial crisis of 2008, China adopted a responsible macro policy, remained a ""stabilizer"" for the world economy and made important contribution to global recovery. China actively provides international public goods to various countries, and has signed BRI cooperation agreements with 149 countries and 32 international organizations. In recent years, President Xi Jinping's vision of building a community with a shared futurefor mankind has been warmly received by the international community. It has been written into multiple important documents issued by the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other multilateral institutions. UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres hailed China as an important pillar for multilateralism, noting that the purpose for practicing multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Peter Thomson, president of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly,said the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind advocated by China is the only future for humanity on this planet. In response tovarious new global challenges, President Xi Jinping put forwardthe Global Development Initiative(GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). They represent China's proposals for making the global governance system fairer and more equitable, and have received positive response and wide supportfrom the international community. The US has blatantly violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the norms governing international relations. Withits military might, the US has launched wars in numerous parts of the world, stoking divisions and conflicts and bringing huge turmoil and disaster to the world. Throughout the240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years in which the US was not at war. The US might as well be called the most belligerent country in the history of the world. US magazine The National Interestquoted Dakota Wood, senior research fellow for defense programs at the Heritage Foundation, who wrote that the US consistently needed to deploy military force every 15 years or so. Since the end of World War II, the United States has either launched or participated in many wars overseas, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Afghan War and the Iraq War. Those wars caused extremely severe civilian casualties and property losses, and lead to colossal humanitarian disasters. Since 2001, US wars and military operations in the name of counterterrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, about 335,000 of whom were civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions. The US habitually puts its domestic law above the international law, and selectively applies international rules as it sees fit. Sincethe 1980s, the US had once withdrawnfrom17 international organizations and treaties,includingthe United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),the Paris Agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT),the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)Treaty and the Treaty on Open Skies. Although the current US administration declared that ""America is back"" and the US has rejoined some international organizations and agreements, the administration has in essence not abandoned the ""America First"" policy, and is advancing ""selective multilateralism"".The current administration has stayed out of institutions and agreements considered harmful to US interests such as the Treaty on Open Skies. European media have described it as ""America First 2.0"". The UShas abusedits financial hegemony andtechnological clout and engaged in economic coercion in the name of protecting national security. The US has enacted some domestic laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and the Countering America\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, andissued aseries of executive ordersto target and sanction specific countries, entitiesor individuals. Theambiguous rulescontained in these acts and executive orders,such as the ""minimum contacts principle"" and ""doctrine of effects"",are a willfulexpansion ofthe jurisdiction ofUSdomestic laws.The US also abuses itsdomesticchannels of prosecutionto exercise long-arm jurisdiction over entities and individuals in other countries. For more than 60 years, intotal disregard of the many resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the US hascontinueditscomprehensive blockade against Cuba based on its embargo policies and domestic laws such as theTorricelli Actand theHelms-Burton Act. The Cuba blockade is the longest and cruelestsystemic trade embargo, economic blockadeand financial sanctions in modern history. The blockade has been gravely detrimentalto Cuba's economic and social development, causing over 100 billion USdollars ofdirect losses to Cuba's economy. The US has carried out blockade and sanctions against Iran sincelate 1970s. In May 2018, the US government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, and soon after resumed and expandedsanctions against Iran. Many countries and relevant entities have beenforced to give up their cooperation with Iran. A large number of foreign oil enterprises left the country. Iran'smanufacturing industry can hardly sustain normal operation. The country has sufferedeconomic slowdown, coupled with heightened inflationand massive currency depreciation. TheUShasimposed unilateral sanctions onBelarus,SyriaandZimbabwe,amongothers, over the years, and ratcheted up""maximum pressure"" againstthe DPRK,Venezuela, etc. Statistics show that the previous US administration had imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which meansitwielded its ""big stick"" three times a dayon average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individualson USsanction liststopped9,421,which was 933percenthigher comparedto the fiscal year 2000. The US'sillegalunilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have gravely undermined the sovereignty and security of other countries and severely impactedtheir economic development and people's wellbeing. The sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction alsoconstitute a gross violation ofinternational law and basic norms of international relations. In an article published in the September/October 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Daniel Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, criticizessuccessive US administrations for using ""sanctions as the go-to solution for nearly every foreign policy problem."" He notes that sanctionsnot only are ineffective, but also ""exert a humanitarian toll"", and thatthe United States of America has become the ""United States of Sanctions"". The ""rules-based international order"" championed by the US is in fact another version of power politics. This is an attempt to impose one\'s own will and standards on others, and to replace the commonly accepted international laws and norms with the house rules of a few countries. In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Before wanting to discuss rules and order, the US should first pay up its arrearsofonebillionUS dollarsfor the UN's regular budget and 1.4 billionUS dollarspeacekeeping assessments, ratify in a timely mannerthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, stop single-handedly blocking the negotiations on a verification protocol under the Biological Weapons Convention(BWC),lift illegal unilateral sanctions, earnestly fulfill its international obligations and set a good example for others in respecting laws and norms. Falsehood 2: The USis not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. It doesn't seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China from growing itseconomy or advancing the interests of itspeople. Reality Check:Despite its claims that it doesn't seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop itfrom growing itseconomy, the US is actually deploying its domestic and external resources to unscrupulouslycontain and suppress China. Without producing any credible evidence, the US government uses national security as a catch-all pretext and all its apparatus to wantonly suppress and sanction Huawei, restricting its products' entry into the US market, cutting off its access to chips and operating system, and coercing countries around the world into banning Huawei from their 5G rollout. The US also orchestrated and pressured Canada to hold Huawei's CFO for nearly three years without cause. In violation of the principle of fair competition and market economy and international trading rules, the USseeks to hamstring competitive Chinese hi-tech companies under all kinds of trumped-up charges.To date, it has placed over 1,000 Chinese companies on various sanctions lists, subjected biotechnology and artificial intelligence technologies to enhanced export controls and stringent investment review, and sought to ban Chinese social media platforms including TikTok and WeChat. Under the pretext of protecting human rights, the US has fabricated misinformation and disinformation concerning Xinjiang such as the existence of""forced labor"" and, on the basis of those unfounded stories, has adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act which maliciously targets Xinjiang\'s competitive cotton, tomatoesand solar photovoltaic sectors to contain China\'s growth. This has disrupted the international trade order and destabilized global industrial and supply chains. The previous US administration, in grave violation of WTO rules, waged a massive trade war on China. Basedon its own Section 301 investigation, it imposed three rounds of steep tariffs on about 360 billion US dollars' worth of Chinese imports. In September 2021, the current US administration initiated aSection 232 investigationto determine the effects on US national security from imports of neodymium-iron-boronpermanent magnetsat a time when global commodity prices were hovering at elevated levels. The US has a record of grossly interfering in China's domestic affairs on issues concerning China's core interests, including Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. It seeks to undermine China's security and stability by, both overtly and covertly, condoning and supporting separatist activities. The bipartisan innovation bills being debated in the US Congress, while professing to enhance US competitiveness, see China as a perceived rival. ""China"" appears more than 800 times in the text, which is packed with provisions detrimental to China\'s interests. In a bid to maintain its power and predominance in international institutions, the US has attempted to smear and block the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the initiative of advancing Belt and Road cooperation, among others, in multilateral fora and also to remove references to them in UN and other international documents. Clinging to a Cold War mentality and the hegemon\'s logic, the US pursues bloc politics, concocts the ""democracy versus authoritarianism"" narrative, cajoles other countries into forming exclusive cliques, strengthensthe Five Eyes, peddles the Quad mechanism, puts together AUKUS with the UK and Australia and ramps up bilateral military alliances, in a clear attempt atcountering China. TheUS pushes NATO to insert itself in Asia-Pacific affairs, fan the ""China threat"" narrative in the bloc\'s new strategic concept, and include in its Madrid Summit such US allies in the Asia-Pacific as Japan, the Republic of Korea(ROK) and Australia, in a bid to build an ""Asia-Pacific version of NATO"", which would disrupt security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The development of state-to-state relations should be based on equality, mutual respect and win-win results. China-US relations have reached an important crossroads. The US should stop viewing this relationship through a Cold War, zero-sum mindset, follow the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and reflect in its action the five assurances it has made to China (i.e. the US does not seek a new Cold War with China, the US does not seek to change China\'s system, the revitalization of US alliances is not against China, the US does not support ""Taiwan independence"", and the US is not looking for conflict with China) . Falsehood 3: Our diplomacy is based on partnership and respect for each other's interests, while China practices coercive diplomacy against other countries and retaliates recklessly. Our task is to prove once again that all countries will be free to chart their own paths without coercion. Reality Check: It is the US that invented ""coercive diplomacy"" and excels at coercing countries. Over the years, by imposing economic blockade, unilateral sanctions and other means, the US has practiced coercive diplomacy around the world with textbook examples. In 1971, American scholar Alexander George first put forward the concept of ""coercive diplomacy"" to summarize the US policy toward Laos, Cuba and Vietnam at that time. The US government forced the military government of Haiti to step down in 1994, and referred to that as ""a textbook example of coercive diplomacy"". In 2003, it explicitly characterized 30.3 billion US dollars additional military expenses for ""coercive diplomacy"" as incurred expenses. The US government froze sevenbillion US dollars assets of the Afghan central bank on the grounds of punishing the Afghan Taliban and even claimed the ""life-saving money"" of the Afghan people as its own, which resulted in the deterioration of thehumanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Mohammad Naeem, spokesman of the Taliban Political Office in Doha, said the seizure is ""indicative of the lowest level of human and moral decay of a country and a nation"". In order to force the Nepalese parliament to approve the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement, the US openly issued an ""ultimatum"", saying that the US will review its ties with Nepal if it failsto ratify the compact. After the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, the US Justice Department established the ""Task Force KleptoCapture"" to find, freeze and seize the yachts, apartments, private jets and huge deposits of Russiancitizensin the US and Europe. This fully shows that the US-touted ""inviolable and sacred right to property"" is just a lie. The US has forced other countries to pick sides and pressured them to join sanctions against Russia. And those who refuse to do so will pay a ""price"". After China and the Solomon Islands had signed a framework agreement on bilateral security cooperation, the US sent senior officials of the National Security Council to the country, doing whatever it can to obstruct the legitimate cooperation between China and Solomon Islands. A Solomn Star article pointed out, ""Washington DC, which has literally forgotten Solomon Islands since World War II, has finally woken up and is applying the heat on the Solomon Islands to abandon the security pact."" In May 2022, on the eve of the High-Level Virtual Meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI, the US exerted pressure on multiple UN development agencies to obstruct their attendance and threatened to ""cut funding"".  The ""Clean Network"" program launched by the previous administration is another textbook example of US coercive diplomacy. Under the pretext of upholding US national security and citizens\' privacy, the program explicitly requires that Chinese companies such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba to be purged from five areas: telecom operators, mobile app stores, mobile apps, cloud services and submarine optical cables. The then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other US politicians lobbied all around the world, coercing countries and regions to join its so-called ""Network"". AUS senior officialeven threatened Cyprus and other countries not to work with Chinese 5G suppliers, or they would bear the consequence. Former UK Business and Industry Minister Vince Cable said the government\'s decision to ban Huawei\'s 5G equipment and services ""had nothing to do with national security"", and was because ""the Americans told us we should do it"". The US shows no mercy in coercing its allies. Out of its geopolitical and energy interestsconsiderations, the US has imposed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project since December 2019. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has imposed new sanctions on related companies and personnel even though Germany had announced the suspension of the certification process for the project. AUSscholar pointed out that American foreign policy since World War II has been based on a simple idea: ""Either you are with us or against us. America should lead, allies should follow, and woe be to countries that oppose its primacy"". His words lay bare the nature of US coercive diplomacy. China never engages in coercive diplomacy and firmly opposes coercive diplomacy by other countries. China never threatens other countries with force, never creates military alliance, never exports ideology, never meddles in others' domestic affairs, never seeks a trade war, and never imposes unjustified oppression on foreign enterprises. That said, however, China has the right to make necessary and legitimate responses to actions that undermine China's sovereignty, security and development rights and interests. Falsehood 4:The US democracy is one of the most powerful assets in this contest. Our task is to prove once again that democracy can meet urgent challenges and that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom. Reality Check: The US sets standards for democracy after its own system, does not allow other systems, pathsand models to exist, and gangs up with others to wantonly interfere in other countries'internal affairs in the name of democracy. This not just contravenes the spirit of democracy, but also spells disaster for democracy. The American-style democracy is a rich men\'s game based on capital. Money politics penetrates the entire process of election, legislation and administrationin the US. People in fact only have a restricted right to political participation. The inequality in economic status has turned into inequality in political status. According to statistics, winners of 91 percent of US congressional elections are the candidates with greater financial support. Big companies, a small group of rich people, and interest groups are more generous to offer financial support and have become the main source of electoral funding. The so-called representatives of people\'s will, once elected, often serve the interests of their financial backers, and speak for vested interests rather than the ordinary people. A US Senator had a sharp observation, ""Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress."" US Republican congressman from Alabama Mo Brooks publicly denounced""corruption"" ofthe US Congressin a video on social media. ""If youwant to be chairman of a major committee, you have to purchase it."" The purchase price depends on how important the committee is, withthe minimum bid for a major committee beingone million US dollars. Those whocannot afford ithave to accept the contributions of special interest groups and thengive""quid pro quos"" tothe lobbyists. ""Special interest groups run Washington. I don\'t mean that metaphorically, I mean that literally."" According to ascholar inSingapore,the United States isclearlynot functioning as a democracy. It is functioning as a plutocracy. A democracy is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. A plutocracy is a government of the one percent, by the one percent, for the one percent. The US presidential election follows the Electoral College system, where the president and vice president are elected by the Electoral College. The flaws of such an electoral system are self-evident. First, as the president-elect may not be the winner of the national popular vote, there is a lack of broad representation. Second, as each state gets to decide its own electoral rules, confusion and disorderoften occur. Third, the winner-takes-all system exacerbates inequality among states and between political parties. It leads to a huge waste of votes and discourages voter turnout. Voters in deep blue and deep red states are often neglected, while swing states become disproportionately more important where both parties seek to woo more supporters. There have been five presidential elections in US history in which the winner of nationwide popular vote was not elected the president. The gerrymandering is widely recognized by the US public as a flaw of the electoral system. Itrefers to an unfair division ofelectoral districtsin favor ofa particularparty to win as many seats as possible and cement its advantage.The US conducts a census every ten years. Following the completion of the census, redistricting or the redrawing of electoral district boundaries will take place under the principle of maintaining roughly equal population in every voting district while considering demographic shifts. Under the US Constitution, each state legislature has the power to redistrict. This leaves room for gerrymandering by the majority party in a state legislature. According to a YouGov poll in 2021, only16 percent of US adult citizens say they think their states'congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44 percent say they think the maps would be drawn unfairly and another 40 percent of adults say they are unsure if the maps will be fair. The American-style democracy is""one person one vote""in name, yet ""rule of a dominant minority""in reality. Political pluralism is only a facade. A small number of elites dominate the political, economic and military affairs. They control the state apparatus and policy-making process, manipulate public opinion, dominate the business community and enjoy all kinds of privileges. According to the Associated Press,18.8 million people were missedin the 2020 US census. The black population had a net undercount of 3.3 percent, while it was almost five percent for Hispanics and 5.6 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans living on reservations. The undercount robs them of their equal share of federal resources including in education, health care and housing and puts them in an unfavorable condition as to congressional apportionment. It reveals the hypocrisy in the US democracy and its ""perpetuating systemic racism"". Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the USis a ""really existing capitalist democracy"", where there is a positive correlation between people\'s wealth and their influence on policy-making. For the lower 70percenton the wealth/income scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever. They are effectively disenfranchised. Wertheimer, President of thenon-profit US organization Democracy 21, says thatcorruptioninthe US is systemic corruption of the process itself. ""When you are dealing with billions and billions of dollars, much of that focused on buying influence, it overwhelms the system, and it is much harder to defend against and maintain representation for ordinary Americans."" Danny Haiphong, an independent journalist in the US,believes that Western-style democracy views the election itself as the highest achievement. The question of whether this system serves the needs of the broad masses of people is generally ignored in order to obscure the fact that powerful corporate interests set the policy agenda well before votes are cast. The checks and balances in the American-style democracyhave resulted in a ""vetocracy"". American political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out in his bookPolitical Order and Political Decaythat there is an entrenched political paralysis in the US. The US political system has far too many checks and balances, raising the cost of collective action and in some cases making it impossible altogether. The US democratic process is fragmented and lengthy, with a lot of veto points where individual veto players can block action by the whole body. The function of ""checks and balances"", which was purportedly designed to prevent abuse of power, has been distorted in American political practice. Politicians in Washington, D.C. are preoccupied with securing their own partisan interests and no longercare about national development. The two parties are addicted to vetoing and caught in a vicious circle. The government efficacy is inevitably weakened, law and justice trampled upon, development and progress stalled, and social division widened. According to a Pew Research Center report in October 2021 based on a survey of 17 advanced economies including the US, Germany and theROK, the US is more politically divided than the other economies surveyed. Nine in ten US respondents believe there are strong conflicts between people who support different political parties, and nearly 60 percent of Americans surveyed think their fellow citizens no longer disagree simply over policies, but also over basic facts. Aspolitical and partisan polarization continues to grow, more ""opposition for opposition\'s sake"" is seen among Democrats and Republicans. Under its influence, voters of the two parties are increasingly antagonizedover gun policy. Among Republican voters, 76 percent support the right to possess guns, while 81 percent of Democratic voters seegun control as more important. Hijacked by interest, partisan conflict and the public opinion, the legislation and law enforcement process of gun control is fraught with difficulties. For the past ten years, Democratic congressmen put forward dozens of bills on gun violence and gun control every year, but due to the continued obstruction from the Republican Party, only a handful of them successfully entered the plenary deliberation and debate stage atthe Senate or the House of Representatives. The US National Rifle Association (NRA) has five million members and spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and lobbying every year. Its tentacles penetrate deep into the fabric of the American society. The NRA is an important funder of the Republican Party. Since its establishment in 1871, the NRA has successfully attracted nineUS presidents to join it.According to CNN statistics in 2018, 307 of the 535 US congressmen have received either direct campaign contributions from the NRA and its affiliates or benefited from independent NRA spending like advertising supporting their campaigns. In the face of huge profits, all kinds of gun control efforts have endedup in vain. The US is not a straight A student when it comes todemocracy.Its practice of democracyhas been messy and chaotic. On 6 January 2021, thousands of Americans gathered on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. and stormed the Capitol building in a bid to stop the joint session of the Congress from certifying the newly-elected president. The incident interrupted the transfer of US presidential power, leaving five dead and over 140 injured. It is the worst act of violence in Washington, D.C. since 1814 when the British troops set fire to the White House, and it sent shock waves throughout the international community. The US Senate Republican leader described it as a ""failed insurrection"". A scholar from the US Council on Foreign Relations says that the US is not nearly as unique as many Americans believe, and that the Capitol riot should put an end to the notion of American exceptionalism, of an eternal shining city on a hill. An American expert on international issues wrote in TheNew York Timesthat while the US leader has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite America. Trump and his supporters would be willing to depart from established constitutional rules and norms with his Big Lie. This may undermine the ability of the US government to transfer power peacefully and legitimately. Consequently none of the institutions will work for long, and the people will be thrust into political and financial chaos. The dysfunctionalAmerican-style democracyhas triggered a trust crisis. Public commitments to the people come with behind-the-scene deals. Political infighting, money politics, and vetocracy make it virtually impossible for quality governance to be delivered as aspired by the general public. Americans are increasingly disillusioned with the US politics and pessimistic about the American-style democracy. A Gallup survey in October 2020 shows that only 19percentof the Americans surveyed are ""very confident"" about the presidential election, a record low since the survey was first conducted in 2004.According to a poll conducted by The Wall Street Journalin June 2022, six out of 10 Americans feel pessimistic about achieving the American dream. APew Research in 2021 shows that 65 percent of Americans see aneed for major reform to the American democracy. People's confidence in the American democracy dropped in 16 developed countries, and 57 percent of respondents think that the American democracy is no longer a good exampleto follow. The Democracy Perception Index released in 2021bya German polling agency revealsthat 44percentof respondents in the 53 countries surveyed are concerned that the US threatensdemocracy in their country. Over the years, despite the structural flaws and problematic practice of its democratic system, the US has been touting the ""alliance of democracies"" and hyping up the narrative of ""democracy versus autocracy"". It is in essence attacking those whohold different views under the banner of democracy, using ideology and values as atoolto suppressothers and advance its own geopolitical strategies. This is hegemony in the guise of democracy.A former CIA official openly stated: ""We will intervene whenever we decide it\'s in our national security interest to intervene. If you don\'t like it, lump it."" The US has pushed for the neo-Monroe Doctrine in Latin America under the pretext of promoting democracy, incited color revolutionsin Eurasia, and remotely controlled the Arab Spring in West Asia and North Africa. These moves have brought chaos and disasters to many countries, gravely undermining world peace, stability and development.As suggested by the French website Le Grand Soir, democracy has long become a weapon of massive destruction for the US to attack countries with different views. Whether a country is democratic or not depends on whether its people are truly the masters of the country. It depends on whether the people have the right to vote, and more importantly, the right to participate; what promises they are given during elections, and more importantly, how many of these promises are delivered after elections; what kind of political procedures and rules are set through state systems and laws, and more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly enforced; and whether the rules and procedures for the exercise of power are democratic, and more importantly, whether the exercise of power is genuinely subject to public oversight and checks. The Communist Party of China (CPC) leads the Chinese people incarryingoutthe whole-process people's democracy in China. It has not only a complete set of institutions and procedures, but also full-fledged civil participation. A comprehensive, extensive, and well-coordinated system of institutions has been formed to ensure that the people run the country, and diverse, open, and orderly channels for democracy are put into place. This allows the entire people to engage in law-based democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight and to manage state as well as economic, cultural, and social affairs in various ways and forms and in accordance with the law. The whole-process people's democracy integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people's democracy with the will of the state. It is a model of socialist democracy that covers all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society. It is a true democracy that works. China's whole-process people's democracyis gaining wider recognition and acclaim from the international community. A British scholarsays that electoral democracy does not breed a close relationship with the people and government, because the people are only called upon to be involved whenever to make elections take place. The Chinese approach is different in that there is a very important consultative component in the way China operates. Democracy is a concrete phenomenon that is constantly evolving. Rooted in history, culture and tradition, it takes diverse forms and develops along the paths chosen by different peoples based on their exploration and innovation. China stays committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries. China has no intention to engage in systemic rivalry or ideological confrontation with the US. China never exports ideology, never interferes in other countries'internal affairs, and never seeks to change the system of the US. Falsehood 5: The US hasprofound differences with the CPC and the Chinese Government.But those differences are between governments and systems  not between our people. Realitycheck: The CPC's leadership is the choice of history andofthe people. The CPC and the Chinese government enjoy the wholehearted support and endorsement of the Chinese people. The US'sattemptto drive wedgesbetween the CPC and the Chinese peopleonly serves to reveal its animosity against China's system and path. The CPChas deep roots among and close ties with the Chinese people. This is what has kept the CPC full of vigor and vitality. By the end of 2021, the CPC had over 95 million members. The CPC is the largest party in the world thathas exercised long-term governance intheworld's most populous country. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has created the two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. Over 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty and 1.4 billion people are moving toward modernization. Over the course of just several decades, China has accomplished what took western developed countries hundreds of years. A Harvard University survey among the Chinese people spanning 13 years found that more than 90 percent of respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government, the highest rate among countries for years running. A trust and credibility survey released in 2022 by Edelman, a renowned US public relations consultancy firm,shows that as many as 91 percent Chinese citizens trust their government in 2021, the highest among all surveyed countries. The previous US administration, in a McCarthyism-style campaign, went all out toattack anddiscredit the CPC. It has attacked Chinese leaders and China'sdomestic and foreign policies, sown discord between the CPC and the Chinese people, flagrantly challenged the leadership and governing positionof the CPC, incited anti-China and anti-CPCsentiment, and imposed visa restrictions on CPC membersand their families. The current administration, since its inauguration,has made no substantive changes to those policies. In June 2021, the US Senate passed the United StatesInnovation and Competition Act of 2021, which is more than 2,000 pages long. It regarded China as a strategic competitor and the main challenge to the US, slandered China\'s development path and domestic and foreign policies, and malignantly urged actions to counterthe ""influenceand malignactivities"" of the CPC. Itasked for more than 200 billionUS dollarsof public funding to ensure USadvantages in key technologysectorsoverChina, and advocated mobilizingUSresources in strategic, diplomatic, economic, and technological realmsto engage in comprehensive strategic competition with China. The US Senate also proposed an appropriation of 300 million US dollars for each ofthe fiscal years 2022 through2026 to ""counter the malign influence"" of the CPC and designated the US Department of State and Agency for International Development to train journalists on investigative techniques necessary to ensure public accountability related to the Belt and Road Initiative, including ""supporting civil societyand independent media"". The US continues to use the CPC backgroundas a pretext forcrackingdown onnormal people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. For some time, Chinese students and visiting scholarsgoing to the UShave been harassed and suppressed by the US. Most of them were asked whether they or their parents areCPC members. Some were repatriated on inconceivable grounds, such as being suspected of military connections simply because they had photos in their mobile phones of military training atcollege. These stop-and-search activities go far beyond what the US claims as ""normal law enforcement"". The CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people shareaninseparable bond. The US says it respects the Chinese people, thenit should respect the development path and political system chosen by the Chinese people and respect the CPC thatrepresents the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. By targeting the CPCand the Chinese government, the US is in effect targeting the Chinese people. Anything done to separate the CPC, the Chinese government and the Chinese people and pit the Chinese people against the CPC and the Chinese government will surely be met with the unanimous opposition and resolute response of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people. Falsehood6: The United States raises human rights issues and calls for change  not to stand against China, but to stand up for peace, security, and human dignity. Reality Check: The human rights of the Chinese people are guaranteed like never before, with a notable increase in their sense of fulfillment, happiness and security. In contrast, the US has been engaged in grave human rights violations both at home and abroad, and its shocking track record makes it the biggest human rights abuser in the world. China always puts people's right to subsistence on top of its agenda, prioritizes the work to enhance their right to development, regards the protection of citizens' lawful rights and interests as its basic task, has made the safeguarding of the rights of ethnic groups an important part of itswork, and considers the protection of people's safety its long-term goal. Guided by a people-centered philosophy, since the day when it was founded, the CPC has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its mission. For the past 100 years, the Party has been working tirelessly for the interest of the people, and has dedicated itself to realizing people's aspirations for a better life. China has been advancing whole-process people's democracy, promoting legal safeguard for human rights, and upholding social equity and justice. The Chinese people now enjoy fuller and more extensive and comprehensive democratic rights. China has created the miracle of eliminating absolute poverty. By the end of 2020, China has lifted all 98.99 million rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty.In 2021, China completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and historically resolved the problem of absolute poverty. Since the launch of reform and opening-up, 770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty as currently defined. Based on the international poverty line of the World Bank, China accounts for 70percentof global poverty reduction over the same period. China met the poverty reduction goal of the UN 2030 AgendaforSustainable Developmentten years ahead of schedule, making major contributions to global poverty reduction and human rights progress. China has also put in place the world's largest education system, the largest social security system and the largest health care system. Since COVID-19 started, China has been acting on the principle ofputting the people and their lives first. Based on China's national conditions, it has formulated and implemented a dynamic zero-COVID guideline, and has been constantly fine-tuning its response measures in light of the evolving situation, to best protect people's life and health and at the same time, ensure sustained, sound and steady socioeconomic development with the pandemic under effective control. Both the infection rate and mortality rate of China are the lowest in the world. As an active participant in global human rights governance, China has made its contribution to and offered its initiatives on world human rights development. In recent years, the concept of ""building a community of shared future"" has been written into the resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council, and China-sponsored resolutions on ""the contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights"" and on ""Promoting Mutually Beneficial Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights"" were adopted multiple times at the Human Rights Council. China also made joint statements on behalf of developing countries on the implementation of the right to development, the promotion of human rights by poverty alleviation, equitable distribution of vaccines, among other subjects, contributing its share to safeguarding the basic human rights of developing countries, which has won it wide recognition and support from the international community. Chinahas been an advocate and a doer in advancing the international human rights cause. A World Bank study estimates, if implemented fully, the Belt and Road Initiative could lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty  those who live on less than $3.2 a day. It shows how participating in Belt and Road cooperation can advance human rights in more countries. In the face of the pandemic, China launched itslargest global humanitarian operation since the founding of the People's Republic, and championed the building of a global community of health for all. To address the global development deficit, China proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) whichsees improving people's welfare and achieving well-rounded human development as the fundamental purpose and goal. The GDI has been echoed and supported by more than 100 countries and many international organizations including the UN. The Initiative galvanizes extensive international consensus for accelerated implementation of the UN 2030 AgendaforSustainable Development, and builds up international synergy for coordinated development, thus providing a strong underpinning for the advancement of the international human rights cause. The right to life is of utmost importance, as survival is the basis of allhuman rights. Endowed with the world's most advanced medical equipment and technologies, the US has registered the world's largest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Pandemic response has been extremely politicized, and become a tool and lever to attack, undercut and oppose each other between the Republicans and the Democrats.Politicians only focus on political gains, with no regard to the life and health of the ordinary people. Its pandemic control, which has been unscientific, unequal and irresponsible, has gravely undermined American people's right to life and health. So far, the COVID-19 death toll in the US has surpassed one million. The deaths are, according to The Atlantic, ""unexpected, untimely, particularly painful, and, in many cases, preventable"". Some politician even suggestedthat old people maysacrifice themselves for the country and that saving the country\'s economy is more important than old people\'s lives. Dataof the US Center for Disease Prevention and Control shows that most COVIDvictims areaged 65 years and above. USC and Princeton researchers project thatdue to the pandemic deaths last year, life expectancy at birth for Americans will shorten by 1.13 years, the sharpest decline since World War II.""For Blacks,thelife expectancywouldshorten by2.10 years,and for Latinos,by3.05 years.Whites are also impacted,buttheirprojected decline ismuchsmaller0.68 years."" TheWashington Postpoints to a far greater number behind the one million death toll: That number is 9 million the number of Americans who have lost spouses, parents, grandparents, siblings and children to COVID. A study by the Imperial College London estimates that morethan250,000US childrenhadlost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19 by 23 May 2020. Figures released by the US Government Accountability Office in March2022 show that up to 23 million people in the US may have developed ""longCOVID"", and an estimated one million people suffering from the symptoms may be pushed out of work. The US is the country most rampant with gun violence. Its population, totaling 333 million or 4 percent of the world's total, own more than 400 million guns or 46 percent of all the private guns in the world. It tops the world in terms of gun ownership, and shooting incidents every now and then in the US takes away more than 110 lives on a daily average. Many people say it is easier to buya gun than baby formula in the US. Data of the US website Gun Violence Archive show about 45,000 Americans are killed in gun violence incidents in 2021. On 24 May 2022, the Robb elementary school shooting in Texas claimed 21 lives, including 19 children. By US media counts, it is the 39th campus shooting this year. According to TheWashington Posttally,202 mass shootings tookplace in the US inthe firstfive and half months this year.For decades, no substantive measures have been taken by the US government to address such problems. In the past 25 years, the US federal government fails to introduce any gun control act. The New York Timesobserved, ""The United States has become ungovernable not because of political differences or protest or a lack of civility, but because this is a country unwilling to protect and care for its citizens its women, its racial minorities and especially its children."" Despite the claim by US founding fathersthat ""All men are created equal"", slavery was preserved in its Constitution of 1789. Although the US has abolished segregation on the surface, white supremacy continues to wreak havoc, and systemic discrimination against racial minorities still exists even to this day. Theentrenched racism, compounded by the coronavirus, has fueled a new spike of hate crimes against Asian-Americans. At the same time, racial persecution of the indigenous people persists, discrimination against the Muslim community worsens, racial economic divide yawns, and racial inequality aggravates day by day. Nearly 60 years on since Martin Luther King\'s ""I Have A Dream"" speech, people still see a brutal reality as reflected in George Floyd\'s ""I can\'t breathe"" plea. Through slaughter, expulsion, sterilization and forced assimilation, the UScommitted a genocide against Native Americans,resulting in a sharp drop in theirpopulation from fivemillion in 1492 to 250,000 in the early 20th century. The Native American community has long been neglected and discriminated against. The indigenous culture was fundamentally crushed, and the inter-generational inheritance of indigenous lives and spirits was under severe threats. Many US government statistical programs either leave them outcompletelyor simply classify them as ""others"". Shannon Keller O'Loughlin, Chief Executive and Attorney of the Association on American Indian Affairs, said that Native Americanshave diverse cultures and languages, but are often seen not as an ethnic group, but as a political stratum with limited autonomy based on treaties with the federal government.The Atlanticcommented that from the expulsion, slaughter and forced assimilationbackin history to the current widespread poverty and neglect, the American Indians, once the owner of this continent, now have a very weak voice in American society. The US government enforced the system of boarding schools in Native American areas to impose Englishand Christian education on Native American children. It also enacted laws prohibiting Native Americans from performing religious rituals which have been passed down through generations. An article titled ""The United States Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides"" carried by Foreign Policy website on 11 October 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, there were more than 350 government funded indigenous boarding schools across the US. Hundreds of thousands of indigenous children passed through, or died in, these schools. The purpose of Indian boarding schools was to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly relocating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities where their American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were to be forcibly suppressed. The US was not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people. Native American writer Rebecca Nagle believes that information about Native Americans has been systematically removed from mainstream media and popular culture. According to a report by National Indian Education Association, 87 percentof state-level US history textbooks do not mention the post-1900 history of indigenous people. According to the Smithsonian Institution, things taught about Native Americans in American schools are full of inaccurate information and fail to present the real picture of the sufferings of indigenous people. Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator, saidpubliclyat the Young America\'s Foundation that ""We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here... but candidly, there isn\'t much Native American culture in American culture."" Islamphobia and the discrimination against and suppression of Muslims and Islam in US mainstream society has become more pronounced. A Bloomberg report on 9 September 2021 observed that discrimination against Muslims in the US increased in the two decades after 9/11. On the same day, the Associated Press cited a survey which found that 53 percent of Americans have negative views toward Islam. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in its 2021 report that it receives an increasing number of complaints each year about bullying and hate speechagainstMuslims. According to the survey findings released by the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley on 29 October 2021, 67.5 percent of Muslim respondents said they had experienced Islamophobia, and an even larger percent of those surveyed, 93.7 percent, said that anti-Muslim hatred had affected their mental or emotional well-being to some degree. The US has serious problems of human trafficking and forced labor. It still has not ratified the Forced Labour Convention (1930), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Every year, nearly 100,000 people are smuggled into the US for forced labor. Today, there are at least half a million people enslaved in the US; roughly 240,000 to 325,000 women and children are victims of sexual slavery. Immigrants and refugees have become a tool of partisan feuding and political rivalry in the US. The government changes its rules and regulations capriciously, enforces laws violently, and immigrants have been subjected to inhuman treatment such as prolonged detention, torture and forced labor. Data released by US Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the US, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. That same year, the US detained more than 1.7 million immigrants at the southern border, including 45,000 children. In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. US border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging toward the crowds to expel them into the river. CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. Turning a blind eye to the systematic violation of the human rights of its own people, the US government has wilfully attacked other countriesand interfered intheir internal affairsin the name of human rights, challenging rightwith might and trampling on justice out ofselfish interest. Since 2001, the US has waged war or conducted military operationsin about 80 countries in the name of ""war on terror"", resulting in the deaths of more than 900,000 people, including 300,000 civilians. The 20-year-long war waged by the US has left Afghanistan devastated and impoverished. A total of 47,245 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers unrelated to 9/11 have been killed and more than 10 million displaced as a result of US operations. The War in Afghanistan has destroyed the foundation of economic development and impoverished the Afghan people. When the US withdrew from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central bank, pushing the Afghan economy to the brink of collapse and making things worse for the Afghan people. At the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council, many countries denounced the US as ""the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world""and urged it to address its own gross human rights problems. The US has been an expert in arbitrary detention and torture. Under the pretext of ""war on terror"", the CIA has set up black sites in at least 54 countries and regions over the years, where more than 100,000 people are detained. A group of independent human rights experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council said in a statement released on 10 January 2022 that the US has arbitrarily detained people without trial and subjected them to torture or ill-treatment in Guantanamo Bay for 20 years in violation of international human rights law, calling this ""a stain on the US Government\'s commitment to the rule of law"". The US should face up to and resolve its own systemic and chronic human rights problems, reflect on the humanitarian disasters and crimes it has caused around the world, and give a responsible account of itself to the international community. Falsehood7: The USremains committed to its""one China"" policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, the Six Assurances. Its policy on Taiwan has not changed. Reality Check:The one-China principle isan established norm of international relations and a universal consensus of the international community. The US has acted faithlessly, kept regressing from its own commitments and the consensus it reached with China, and attempted to weaken and undermine the one-China principle and use Taiwan to contain China. This is a major threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted, with an overwhelming majority,Resolution 2758,which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People\'s Republic of China in the UN, and has solved once and for all the issue of China\'s representation in the UN in political, legal and procedural terms. The official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat pointed out explicitly that ""the United Nations considers \'Taiwan\' as a province of China with no separate status"", the ""\'authorities\' in \'Taipei\' are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status"", and ""Reference to \'Taiwan\' ... should read \'Taiwan, Province of China\'"". Onthe basis of the one-China principle, China has established diplomatic relations with 181 countries, including the US. The US made the following commitments to China regarding the one-China principle in the three China-US joint communiqus. In the Shanghai Communiqu released in 1972,the US explicitly stated that ""The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position"". In the Joint Communiqu on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations released in 1978, the US clearlystated that ""The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People\'s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China"";""The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"". In the August 17 Communiqu released in 1982, the US unequivocally stated that ""In the Joint Communiqu on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on January 1, 1979, issued by the Government of the People\'s Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America, the United States of America recognized the Government of the People\'s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and it acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"", and that ""it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China\'s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of \'two Chinas\' or \'one China, one Taiwan\'"". According to this Communiqu, ""the United States Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. In so stating, the United States acknowledges China\'s consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this issue"". Ratherthan faithfully abiding by its commitments on Taiwan, the US has kept backpedaling on history. On the political front, the US has added the so-called ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and the ""Six Assurances"" to the expression of its one-China policy, with a growing list of such prefixes. Both prefixes are unilaterally made by the US side in breach of its commitments in the three China-US joint communiqus as well as the one-China principle affirmed in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and widely observed by the international community. They are illegal, null and void from the very beginning, and China has never acknowledged and has firmly rejected them from the outset. The US has also violated its commitment of maintaining unofficial relations only with Taiwan and kept upgrading the level of engagement. In recent years, senior US officialsincluding the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Under Secretary of State as well as members of Congress have visited Taiwan. US ambassadors overseas have also met with Taiwan\'s so-called ""representatives"" in their host countries. In the military field, the US has reneged on its commitment ""that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution"". Instead of ceasing the arms sales, it has sold weapons at a larger scale and with enhanced capability including assault weaponries such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy weight torpedoes, and F-16V fighter jets. To date, the total volume of US arms sales to Taiwan has exceeded 70 billion US dollars. According to reports by Reuters and other new agencies, US special operations forces have been rotating into Taiwan on a temporary basis to train with Taiwanese forces. Since2021, the US leader has stated publicly on three occasions that the US would help defend Taiwan in case of a war in the Taiwan Strait. On the international stage, the US has been assisting Taiwan in expanding its so-called ""international space"". Recently, the US has been spreading globally the fallacy that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not determine the status of Taiwan, and that each country should be able to determine the contours of its own ""one China""policy.It has vigorously advocated support for Taiwan\'s participation as an observer in the 75th session of the World Health Assembly, and even blatantly helped to consolidate Taiwan\'s ""diplomatic relations"". These US acts have breached its commitment that ""it has no intention of ... pursuing a policy of \'two Chinas\' or \'one China, one Taiwan\'"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2022, former US Secretary of State HenryKissinger said, ""my understanding of the agreement (China and the US reached upon the establishment of diplomatic relations) has been that the United States would uphold the principle of one China ...it is essential that these principles be maintained, and the United States should not by subterfuge or a gradual process, develop something of a two-China solution"". The DPP authorities have been stubbornly advancing its ""Taiwan independence"" separatist agenda, and the US has been encouraging and supporting ""Taiwan independence"" forcesovertly and covertly. This is the root cause of current tensions across the Taiwan Strait. To defend peace across the Taiwan Strait and beyond, we must forestall the growing tendency of ""Taiwan independence"" and the collusion between the US and Taiwan. The one-China principle must not be challenged. China\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be infringed upon. And the red line that no one should pursue a policy of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"" must not be crossed. China is fully confident, capable and prepared to resolutely curb ""Taiwan independence"" separatist activities, resolutely foil all external interferences, and firmly safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US should abide by the provisions in the three China-US joint communiqus, follow a true one-China policy, and act on its commitments including on not supporting ""Taiwanindependence"". The US needs to genuinely reflect on and redress its regressive and erroneous behavior, and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question. Otherwise, it would gravely jeopardize peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, undermine China-US relations and incur an unbearable cost on itself. Falsehood 8: The United States stands with countries and people around the world against the genocide and crimes against humanity happening in the Xinjiang region, where more than a million people have been placed in detention camps because of their ethnic and religious identity. Reality Check: The human rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully protected. There is no ""genocide""or ""crimes against humanity""in Xinjiang. The US has been spreadingdisinformation about Xinjiangsimplyto create an excuse fordiscreditingand attackingChina. Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, but about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism. According to figures available,between1990 andthe end of 2016, there were several thousand incidents of violent and terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, killing large numbers of innocent people and hundreds of police officers, and causing immeasurable property damage. In response tosuchreal threats, Xinjiang has acted resolutelyto fight terrorism and extremism in accordance with law. At the same time, a series of supporting measureshave been taken, like improving people's livelihoods, raising public awareness about law, and offering help through vocational education and training centers. The trend offrequent terrorist activitieshas thus been effectively curbed. There has been no violent act of terrorismin Xinjiang for five consecutive yearsand more. The region has enjoyed security, social stability and good development. The safety and securityof people of all ethnic groupshave been effectively protected. ""Genocide""in Xinjiang is a complete ""lie of the century"". Over the past 60 years and more, the Uyghur population has increasedfrom 2.2 million to about 12 million, and theiraverage life expectancy has grownfrom 30 to 75years. With stabilityprevailing in Xinjiang, local people live and work in peace and happiness.The region has made unprecedented progressin delivering economic and social development and in bettering people's lives. Between 2014 and 2019, GDPin Xinjiang rosefrom 919.59 billion yuan to 1.36 trillion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent, while per capita disposable income grewby an average annual rate of 9.1 percent. Remarkable achievements have been made in eliminating extreme poverty. All 3.09 million impoverished people by current standardshave been lifted out of poverty, making absolute poverty a thing of the past in Xinjiang. The lawfulrights and interests of the people of all ethnicitiesin Xinjiang have been protectedeffectively. All ethnic groups, regardless of their populations, have equallegal status and enjoy freedom of religious beliefand various rights in accordance with law, includingparticipatingin the management of state affairs, receiving education, using their own languages, and preserving their traditional culture. In July 2019, permanent representatives of more than 50 countries in Geneva sent a joint letter to the President of the UN Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, praising China's achievements in fighting terrorism, deradicalization and human rights protection. In October 2019, more than 60 countries spoke at the Third Committee of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, commending the tremendous human rights advancement in Xinjiang. In June 2021, more than 90 countries made joint or separate statements at the Human Rights Council in support of China. In the meantime, Canada took the lead in attacking China on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. Just a little over 40 countries echoed Canada's criticism, and none of them are from the Muslim world. In recent years, over2,000 peoplefrom more than 100 countries, including experts, scholars, journalists, diplomatsand religious figures, have visited Xinjiang, witnessing the unity, harmonyand happinessofpeople of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The so-called ""genocide"" in Xinjiang is a lie cooked up by anti-China forces represented bythe anti-China German scholar Adrian Zenz. He is a member of the far-right group ""Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation""sponsored by the US government, and a key figure in an anti-China organization set up by US intelligence agencies. He is also a racist. His ""research""is full of inconsistencies, fabrications and data manipulation. It does not have any academic credibility and cannot be cleared foracademic publication. For example, achartin Zenz\'s ""paper""claims that new IUD placementsin Xinjiangaverage between 800 and 1,400per personeach year,which means each woman in the region would have to undergo four to eight such insertion surgeries every day. This is totally against common sense. On 29June 2020, the JamestownFoundation of the US published a ""research report"" byAdrian Zenz, in which hefalsely accused the Chinese government of committing ""genocide"" against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Uponthe release of the report, US politicians including then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious FreedomSam Brownback, Senator Marco Rubio and House Representative Jim McGovern immediately pitched in to whip up the ""genocide"" accusation. Rubio, McGovern, Senator John Cornyn and Senator RobertMenendezwent on to urge the administration to makea genocidedetermination of China\'s policy on Xinjiang. Contradictingthe conclusion reached by lawyers atthe State DepartmentOffice of the Legal Adviser, Pompeo announcedthat""I have determined that the People\'s Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups"" on 19January2021, the lastday of the previous administration.The current administration has followedthe same positionand continuedto allege ""genocide""inXinjiang. Thisfurther exposes the US\'sreal intentionof political manipulation in the name of human rights. TheWorld Uyghur Congress, an anti-China separatist organization, hired peoplelike Sayragul Sauytbay and Tursunay Ziawudun to make false statementsand spread all kinds of lies about""persecution"". In the 70-plus press conferences held so far by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, falsehoods spreadbyanti-China forceshave been debunked with solid facts. For instance, some ""performers""who claimed to be the victims offorced sterilizationin vocational education and training centers have never been to one. The family members orfriendsreported by some ""performers"" as missing are actually living anormal life in Xinjiang. The false claim about""millions of Uyghurs detained"" in education andtraining centers was initiated and spread by ""Chinese Human Rights Defenders"", an NGO supported by the US government. Based on interviews with eight Uyghurs and rough estimation, the organization came tothe preposterous conclusion that at least 10 percent of the 20 million people in Xinjiang are detained in ""reeducation camps"". The education andtraining centers in Xinjiang are no different in nature from deradicalization centersor communitycorrection and desistance and disengagement programs inmany other countries. It has been proven to bea successful exploration in preventative counter-terrorism and deradicalization, consistent with the principle and spirit of counter-terrorismresolutions including the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategyand the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.At the centers, trainees acquire greater proficiency instandard spoken and written Chinese language and employability, and gaina stronger sense of national identity, citizenship andrule of law. By October 2019, all trainees hadgraduated from the centers. Most of them havesteady employment after finding jobs by themselvesor with the help of the government, or startingup their own businesses. The US and some other Western countries have been making an issue of human rights in Xinjiang in total disregard of the basic reality ofhuman rights protection and development there. It has become a means for them to achievetheirstrategic objective of using Xinjiang as a pretext to contain China.Lawrence Wilkerson, a retired US Army Coloneland chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, said publicly in August 2018 that one ofthe three-fold purpose of the US military\'s presence in Afghanistanis the containment of China ""If the CIA would want to destabilize China, that would be the best way to do it  to form an unrest, and join with those Uyghurs in pushing ... Beijingfrom internal places rather than external"". Falsehood9: The CPC has imposed harsh anti-democratic measures in Hong Kong under the guise of national security. Beijing's quashing of freedom in Hong Kong violates its handover commitments, enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Reality Check: By attacking and smearing the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), what the US is really up to is to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and make Hong Kong a ""bridgehead""for infiltration and interference against the mainland. Hong Kong is China\'s Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely China\'s internal affairs that brook no interference from the US. For a long time, the UShas colluded with the anti-China, destabilizingforces in Hong Kong, interfered in Hong Kong's political agenda, stoked up social tensions, and even directly intervened in Hong Kong affairs. The US Consul-General in Hong Kong publicly criticized the Hong Kong SAR government for the proposed legislative amendments in 2019 and the One Country, Two Systems. Officials from the US Consulate-General in Hong Kong also met with theso-called leaders of the rioters. The rioters openly admitted that they had discussed withtheUS the legislative process of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and urged the US to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to the Hong Kong police. Funded and incited by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)and otherUS government\'s ""white gloves"", anti-China rioters in Hong Kong committedvandalizing, looting and arson in the name of the so-called fight for ""democracy""and ""freedom"", and violently stormed the building of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of Hong Kong. NED even appeared publicly on the street to direct relevant activities, attempting to stage a ""color revolution""in Hong Kong. NED contacted opposition parties, groups and organizations in Hong Kong through its affiliating National Democratic Institute for International Affairs or the National Democratic Institute (NDI). NDI funded the ""1 July marches""orchestrated by the opposition to obstruct legislation on Article 23, funded the participation of opposition parties and groups at workshops and seminars, and provided personal counseling on campaigning skills for their leaders, ran a so-called ""young political leaders program""to support emerging political groups in confronting the government, plotted, together with opposition members of LegCo, a ""five-district referendum"", and directed and funded the opposition and young radicals in orchestrating the illegal ""Occupy Central""movement. According to the NED website, two million US dollars were spent on 11 Hong Kong-related projects in 2020, with a particular focus on disrupting LegCo elections. Key projects include: ""Strengthening Citizen Election Observation"", which offered technical and financial assistance to newly formed destabilizing groups in Hong Kong, and encouraged them to obstruct LegCo elections by means of election monitoring, get-out-the-vote methods, etc.; ""Amplifying Citizens\' Perspectives on Political Participation"", which collected and disseminated survey findings on democratic development, and induced young Hong Kongers to share their political participation experiences on the Internet; ""Supporting Unity Among Student Activists"", which called for better coordination among Hong Kong student groups prior to LegCo elections, and instructed and trained them to build capacity for ""democratic change"" and international communication and to play a role in disrupting electoral order; and ""Building Regional Solidarity and Empowering the Hong Kong Movement"", which sought to strengthen Hong Kong\'s ""democratic movement"" through network building, cultivate next-generation ""leading activists"" in Hong Kong, and set up a network of ""democratic movement"" in Asia. US officials used ""violence"" and ""shame""to describe the storming of the Capitol building by protesters, but labeledthe violent, criminal activitiesin Hong Kongthat assaulted residents and damaged public facilitiesas ""a beautiful sight to behold"".The US police used armored vehicles to disperse demonstrators, abused their force to beat and drive away sit-in demonstrators, and arrested demonstrators after deliberately inducing them to walk on vehicle laneswhich constitutes violation of the law, while discrediting the Hong Kong SAR government\'s law-based actions to protect people\'s rights and the public order as ""violation"" of human rights. This is another display ofUS-stylehypocritical double standardsand exposes its intention to undermine prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and contain Chinaunder the pretextof human rights and democracy. During the150-plus yearsof British colonial rule, there was no democracy in Hong Kongwhatsoever. None of thegovernorswasdemocratically elected by Hong Kong residents. For most of the time, Legco members were directly appointed by the governor. In stark contrast, after the return of Hong Kong, pursuant to the Basic Law, Hong Kong has come to enjoy the executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. Itsresidents are masters of the SAR as provided by law who manage their own affairs within the scope of the high degree of autonomy. They enjoy a wide range of democratic rights and freedoms like never before. This is a fact that every fair-minded person would recognize. The purpose of enacting the National Security Law in Hong Kong is to close the legal loopholes in safeguarding national security in the SAR. It is a legitimate and necessary move to respond toviolent terrorist activities and illegalexternal interferencein Hong Kong. Constitutions of more than 100 countrieshave stipulations that the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms shall not endanger national security. According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and public trial may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety and order.The European Convention on Human Rights has similar provisions. Thenational security law specifically targets four categories of crimes: secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.It seeks to punish a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security and protect the vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong citizens. Itprovides better protection forthe rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents and the high degree of autonomy ofHong Kong enshrined in law. It creates theconditions needed for addressing the deep-seated problems in the economy and concerning people's livelihood. It also helpsmaintain the rule of law and business environment in Hong Kong, ease the concerns of the business communityabout social disorder, and offer better conditions for people from around the world who want to work, invest and live in Hong Kong. Over the past two years or so since the National Security Law was enacted, the rule of law in Hong Kong has been strengthened and better guaranteed. Hong Kong's rule of law index continues to stay among the topin the world. Foreign investors have stronger confidence in the city.Hong Kong is seeing a bright prospect transitioning from chaos to order andto prosperity. According to the 2022 AmChamHong KongBusiness Sentiment Survey releasedearly this year, the number of businessesin Hong Kong optimistic about Hong Kong's business outlookincreasedby 18 percent from the previous year, while the number of businessesthat are pessimistic was down by 17 percent. The legal basis for the Chinese government to govern Hong Kong is the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is not relevant in this regard.As China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, all provisions concerning the UK under the Joint Declaration had been fulfilled. The basic policies regarding Hong Kong stated by China in the Joint Declaration are China\'s declaration of its policies, which have since been fully embodied in the Basic Law enacted by the National People\'s Congress. These policies have not changed; they will continue to be upheld by China.The Joint Declaration does not assign the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong nor give it any right to intervene in Hong Kong affairs after the return of Hong Kong. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or ""right of supervision""over Hong Kong after its return. The Joint Declaration is a bilateral instrument between China and the UK; it does not involve any other country or has anything to do with a third country. Sovereign equality and non-interference are enshrined in international law and are basic norms of international relations. Other countries and organizations have no right to meddle in Hong Kong affairs on the grounds of the Joint Declaration. TheCentral Government of China has unswervingly implemented the policyof One Country, Two Systems. Since Hong Kong's return, the policyof One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomyhasbeen earnestly implementedwithwidely recognized achievements. Practice has fully proven that One Country, Two Systems is the best institutional arrangement for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. The Central Government will continue to ensure that the policy of One Country, Two Systems remains unchanged, is unwaveringly upheld, and in practice is not bent or distorted. Turninga blind eye to the fact that Hong Kong\'s democracy has improvedin waysunseen before its return, the US has acted against Hong Kong\'s mainstream public opinion for unity and progressand madeirresponsible remarks on Hong Kong\'s high degree of autonomy, human rights and freedom as the ""preacher""of democracy. This only exposes itshypocriticaldouble standards and the agenda to destabilize Hong Kong and contain China. Falsehood 10: China purports to champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while standing with and defending the Russian government that brazenly violate them. Reality Check: On the Ukraine issue, China has always adhered to an objective and just position, a position shared by most countries.The Cold War mentality and power politics is the root cause ofthe Ukraine crisis. The US should earnestly shoulder its due responsibilities and take concrete actions to ease the situation and solve the problems. The US has betrayed its own promises and kept pushing for the eastward expansion of NATOcreating the Ukraine crisis. When meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, the then US Secretary of State James Baker gave clear assurances that ""there would be no extension of NATO\'s jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east"". However, the US has led fiverounds of NATO eastward expansion since 1999, increasing its membership from 16 to 30, and advancing NATO more than 1,000 kilometers eastward to the Russian border, forming a C-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea. In 1997, former US diplomat and observer on the Soviet Union George Kennan wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed that ""expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era."" In 2014, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in the Washington Post that if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it should not join NATO, and that it must not be either side's outpost against the other  it should function as a bridge between them. At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2022 in Davos, Kissinger said that Ukraine shouldhave been a bridge between Europe and Russia, but that opportunity does not now exist in the same manner. Russia has been for 400 years an essential part of Europe, and on a number of occasions as the guarantor by which the European balance could be re-established. Current policy should keep in mind the restoration of this role is important to develop. An American expert on international affairs points out in an article that the US government should bear considerable responsibility for the deterioration of relations with Russia caused by its major mistake of greenlighting the NATO expansion. Noting that ""America and NATO aren\'t innocent bystanders"", he also believed that it is ""the height of folly"" for some US officials to brag in public about leaks or even intelligence sharing between the US and Ukraine. He warned that such instigation on the US side could dangerously widen the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. According to Clare Daly, Member of the European Parliament, the US has been adding fuel to the fire on Ukraine because they want to weaken Russia and benefit from the crisis, for which Europe will pay a heavy price. These is still no hope of peace in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, mainly because the US does not want Russia and Ukraine to reach a peace agreement. Former US Senator Bill Bradley said that ""the fundamental blunder that the United States made in the late 80s, early 90s was the expansion of NATO"". Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview if Joe Biden simply promised not to include Ukraine into NATO, the war would have been prevented. Over the years,the US has pursued interventionism and grossly violated the sovereignty of Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, Syria and other countries.Alfred de Zayas, a senior UN expert, said in anexclusive interview that from the perspective of international law, Russia\'s military actions in Ukraine violated the UN Charter, but the United States and NATO have broken international law so often over the years that ""precedents of permissibility"" have therefore been set for Russia\'s current actions in terms of customary international law. TheUS has been fanning the flames on the Ukraine issue. Instead of promoting peace talks, the US continued to provide weapons to Ukraine, escalating tensions and expanding the conflict, making it more prolonged and complicated. This has sufficiently exposed the selfish nature of the US. On 25 April2022, US Defense Secretary Austin said after a visit to Ukraine that the US wants to use the war to ""see Russia weakened"". In late May2022, on top of the original 13.6 billion dollars aid, the US Congress voted to approve another over 40 billion dollars in military and economic aid to Ukraine. The total assistance has exceeded 70percentof the combined military expenditure of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The ongoing crisis has costEurope heavily in political, economic and social aspects, but the US is reaping dividends, with itsarms dealers, food and energy companiesgaining huge profits. For example, the market value of US military industrial giants has surged by hundreds of billions, and the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exported to Europe is more than 10 times higher than a year ago. As the result of the conflict, more than 6.5 million Ukrainians have fled into neighboring European countries, posing an unprecedented refugee crisis. But the US admitted only 12 refugees from Ukraine in March 2022. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees remainstranded on the US-Mexico border, and many were in US custody. Even whenthe UN and the international community are calling for an early end to the conflict, some in the US are still claiming that they would ""fight to the last Ukrainian"". The relationship between China and Russia features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting at any third party. It is essentially different from the practice of the US and a small number of other Western countries, where they still stick to the Cold War mentality and a friend-or-foe dichotomy to draw ideological lines, form so-called ""alliances"" and ""cliques"", pursue bloc politics and create confrontation and division. In the joint statement issued on 4February 2022, China and Russia call on all to champion humanity's common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, respect the rights of all peoples to independently determine the development paths of their countries, and the sovereignty, security and development interests of all countries, protect the UN-centered international system, and the international order based on international law, seek true multilateralism with the UN and its Security Council playing a central and coordinating role, promote more democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development across the world. As a responsible major country, China's decisions and judgments on the Ukraine issue are made independently based on the merits of the matter. China has made great efforts to safeguard international peace and security, and has been committed to promoting talks for peace and deescalating tensions. China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, that legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported. China's position is objective, fair and consistent with the aspirations of most countries. Of the 233 sovereign countries and regions in the world, 185 are not involved in sanctions on Russia. Among the more than 190 members of the UN, more than 140 countries, including NATO member state Turkey, have refused to impose sanctions on Russia. The combined population of countries and regions participating in sanctions against Russia andthose not is 1.1 billion versus 6.5 billion. Among them, those who openly oppose sanctionshave a combined population of 4.8 billion. About two-thirds of the world's population does not support Western positions on Ukraine, according to a report by the British Economist magazine. Falsehood 11: The USis setting up new coalitions in the Indo-Pacific for regional peace and stability, and has launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), as it ""shares the vision that the regional countries and people across the region hold: one of a free and open Indo-Pacific."" Reality Check: The so-called US vision of a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" is essentially a strategy to divide others, incite confrontation and undermine peace. It runs counter to the trend of the times in the Asia-Pacific, i.e., the trend of peaceful development and win-win cooperation. The US administration\'s Indo-Pacific strategy is self-contradictory: the US claims to promote the region\'s ""freedom and openness"" as its goal, while in reality co-opting with allies to forge a ""five-four-three-two-one"" formation made up of the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, bilateral alliances and IPEF, forming exclusive ""small circles"" and forcing countries in the region to take sides. AUKUS helps Australia build nuclear-powered submarines and develops hypersonic weapons, pushing up the risk for a regional arms race. Under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing and keeping supply chains resilient, the Quad has vigorously pursued military cooperation and intelligence sharing. The US has also encouraged NATO\'s involvement in the Asia-Pacific. These are all attempts to materialize an ""Asia-Pacific version of NATO"" and promote ""integrated deterrence"" against China. The Indo-Pacific strategy has raised increasing alarm and concern of many countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific. As BBC reported, in April 2021, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahutaexpressed New Zealand's discomfort with expanding the Five Eyes' remit by putting pressure on China in this way, and New Zealand still prefers to pursue bilateral relations with China. At the US-ASEAN Special Summit, ASEAN countries stressed their aspiration for peace and cooperation, not for taking sides, division or confrontation. The US has made clear that IPEF is to enable it to win the contest in the 21st century. This means that the IPEFis designed to serve the US economy. The US has shelved the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) for a long time, left the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and refused to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This exposes the self-serving nature of the US and its selective approach to international institutions. It is all about the US' self-interests, nothing mutually beneficial. IPEF is a political instrument of the US in propping up its hegemony in the regional economy. The essence is to dominate the supply chains, value chains and new economic sectors, and marginalize specific countries. The US has chosen to weaponize economic issues as political and ideological ones, using economy to coerce regional countries into taking sides between China and the US. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai publicly stated that IPEF is a standalone arrangement independent from China.US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondosaid IPEF marks the US\'s restoration of economic leadership in the region and presents Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China\'s approach.Previously, shealso expressed that IPEF may harmonize export controls and other ""poisonpills"", such as limiting sensitive products export to China. IPEFseeks to establish US-led trade rules, restructure the industrial chain system and economically and scientifically ""decouple""regional countries from China.Many countries in the region getconcerned,and believe that the cost of such ""decoupling""will be huge.Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad noted that any trade alliance that excludes the world\'s second largest economy is not conducive to closer, multilateral trade cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The US\'s exclusion of China is not an economic issue but a political one. Hailed as ""menu approach"" cooperation, IPEF actually pays little regard to the development level and real needs of the regional countries. It barely gives concessions to developing countries on tariff reduction and market access, but forces participating countries to accept the so-called high standards of the USanditsunilateral agenda. IPEF focuses solely on the US\'s self-interests and cares little about the needs of other parties. There is no such thing as mutual benefit in IPEF. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) pointed out in its report ""Regional Perspectives on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework"" that IPEF has little more to offer than enlarging the US economic presence in the region. It fails to address the issues of the greater interests of regional countries. There is widespread concern that IPEF will only benefit the US, while saddling participating regional countries with a heavy burden. Falsehood12: China has announced its ambition to create a sphere of influence in the Pacificregion.It isadvancing unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea, undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation and commerce. The US will continue to oppose Beijing's aggressive and unlawful activities in the South and East China Seas. It will support the region's coastal states in upholding their maritime rights, work with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, and will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows. Reality Check:China is committed to the path of peaceful development, the five principles of peaceful coexistenceand opposesthe practice of the big and strong bullying the small and weak. The US, by painting China as a threat and using ""freedom of navigation"" as a pretext to undermine China\'s sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests, is actually the real threat to regional peace and security. China stands for equality among all countries irrespective of their size, respects every country's choice of developmentpath suited to its national condition, and does not seek any sphere of influence. China pursues a defensepolicy that is defensive in nature and a military strategy of active defense. In developing its defense capabilities, China aims to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, anddoes not target any other country. The growth of China's defense capabilities amplifies the force for peacein the world. China is the first to have discovered, named, and explored and exploitedNanhai Zhudao and relevant waters, and the first to have exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction over them continuously, peacefully and effectively. China's sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao and its relevant rights and interests in the South China Sea have been established in the long course of history. They are solidly grounded in history and law, and have been upheld by successive Chinese governments and recognized by the international community. Pursuant tothe 1943 Cairo Declarationand the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, China recovered territories illegally occupied by Japan including Xisha Qundao and Nansha Qundaoafter WWII, and has since affirmed sovereignty and strengthened jurisdiction by establishing official names, publishing maps, creating administrative units and stationing troops. China's resuming itsexercise of sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao is a legitimate and lawful act to inherit China's rights established over the course of history. It is also part of the post-WWII international order, and has been recognized by countries around the world including the US. With the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the overall situation in the South China Sea remains stable. With the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), the parties have increased dialogue, properly handled differences, deepened cooperation and enhanced mutual trust, and have made active progress in advancing consultations on the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, in an effort to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and inject positive dynamicsinto regional and global security, stability and prosperity. Despite COVID-19, the parties have held offline Senior Officials' Meetings on the implementation of the DOC and 10 joint working group meetings via video link to advance consultations on the COC text. Last month, the first face-to-face COC consultations since COVID-19 was held in Cambodia. Such positive progress speaksvolumes about the resolve and commitment of regional countries to steadfastly advance consultationstoward aCOC. China respects and supports all countries'freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea in accordance with international law, and actively safeguards the security of and unimpeded passage throughinternational shipping lanes. In fact, the South China Sea is one of the world's safest and freest sea lanes. Fifty percent of merchant vessels in the world and one-third of international maritime trade pass through it, and more than 100,000 merchant ships sail through it annually. Freedom ofnavigation and overflight in the South China Sea hasnever been an issue. Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territory.China's patrol and law enforcementmissions in waters off the Diaoyu Dao are legitimate measures taken by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with lawand are necessary responses toJapanese provocations in violation of China's sovereignty. No country or force should misjudge the strong resolve of the Chinese government to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the same time, China stays committed to properly handlingand resolvingissues through dialogue and consultation, and has made great efforts to maintain maritime stability. In 2014, a four-point principled consensus was reached between China and Japan to handle and improve China-Japan relations,which includes a clear understanding on managing the situation surrounding Diaoyu Dao andthe East China Sea. Acting under the logic of theMonroe Doctrine, the US often uses power politics and hegemonicand bullying acts to flagrantly undermine the international maritime order, with a view to sustaining its maritime predominance. In the 240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years when the countrywas not at war with others. The US operates over 800 military bases in 80 countries and regions. Its military expenditure, which has toppedthe world for many years in a row, accounts for one-fourthof the global total and is equivalent to the combined military spending of the next nine countries. Recently, the US has proposed a national defense budget request of about 813 billion US dollars for fiscal year 2023. Such massive military spendingmakes the USthe real ""pacing challenge"" to the world. The US disregards the historyand facts surroundingthe South China Sea issue, deliberately stokes disputes on territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and sows discord among regional countries. It has become the biggest force undermining stability and fueling militarization in the South China Sea. Data from relevantorganizationsshow that the number of US close-in reconnaissance activities targeting China has more than doubled over the past decadeand more. Right now, an average of five US naval vessels cruise near China's shore everyday. This year, US navalvessels have been sailing through the Taiwan Strait about once a month, and large US reconnaissance planes have flown over 800 times close to Chinaand repeatedly violatedChina's airspace. Eager to stir up trouble in theSouth China Sea, the US has also encouraged its allies and partners to sail their naval vessels into the South China Sea. On 2 October 2021, USS Connecticut, anuclear submarine, had an underwatercollision in the South China Sea. It was not until a week laterthat the US issued a vague statement, claiming that the submarine hit an unknown object. One month after, it said that the submarine ""grounded on an uncharted seamount"". A final report on the accident was eventually released by the US Navy on 23 May 2022, yet noclear explanation has been offeredin response to the grave concerns and questions raised by many, including the intent of the submarine, the specific location of the accident, whether the submarine had entered exclusive economic zones (EEZ)andeven territorial sea of other countries, and whether the accident had caused a nuclear leak or damaged marine environment. The US began its Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program in 1979 ahead of the signing of the UNCLOS. Challenging the new maritime order, the move sought tomaximizethe freedom of the US military torampagethrough the oceans. The FON Program is not consistentwith the universally recognized international law, disregards the sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests of the many littoral countries, and seriously jeopardizes regional peace and stability. Its goalis to advance American maritime supremacy under the pretext of ""freedom of navigation"". The FON Programhas been firmly opposed by many members of the international community, especially the developing countries. Falsehood13: Chinese government officials spread disinformation. Reality Check:China is the top victim of disinformation, while the US is the biggest source of spreading disinformation. With sharp confrontation between the Republicans and Democrats, habitual lying, finger-pointing and blame-shifting among politicians have become part of the US political ecology. A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Pearson Institute at the University of Chicago reveals that nearly half of the respondents blame the US government for the spread of misinformation. The US has used disinformation to launch multiple wars across the globe in pursuit of its hegemonic agenda. Colin Powell, the then US Secretary of Stateaccused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destructionwith a test tube of ""laundry powder"". The US blamed the Syrian government for using bio-chemical weapons against its own peoplewith fake videos by the White Helmets. In 2019, the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly claimed that ""we lied, we cheated, we stole  we had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment."" On4 May 2022, Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke bluntly at a Senate hearing, ""Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The US government."" Manipulation by US politicians has seriously undercut themedia'scredibility. A Gallup poll in 2020 shows that 60 percent ofAmericans remain largely distrustful ofthe media, among whom33percenthave no trust at all, which is 5 percentage points higher than that of 2019. The US has on multiple occasions fabricated numerous lies and rumorson issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, democracy and human rights, including the so-called ""lab-leak theory"", ""genocide"" and ""forced labor"", which have all been defeated by facts. Sincethe Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US has kept spreading disinformation on China and made unfounded accusations against it, in order to shirk its responsibilities for triggering the conflict withNATO's eastward expansion. The New York Timesquoted from anonymous US senior officials who claimed that China had prior knowledge of Russian military operation in Ukraine. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Representative to the UN, said at a Security Council meeting that Chinahad been spreading disinformation in support of Russia. This is sheer fabrication and slandering. Meanwhile, as part of the fierce hunt of voices different from its own, the US has added special labels to Tweets sharing links of Chinese media reports, while turning a blind eye to the Western media that are actually telling the lies. The US has used disinformation as a political tool to attack and suppress China, and formed a supply chain of anti-China rhetoric combining dirty funding, fact-twisting stories and massive smear campaigns. On the surface, these anti-China rhetoric come from certain media outlets and politicians, but what lies underneath is a massive capital-driven supply chain  some institutions and organizations from the US and other Western countries provide dirty funding for political purposes to anti-China groups and individuals; some think-tanks and academic institutions make up fact-twisting stories to fuel anti-China rhetoric around the world through Western hegemony on public opinion; and politicians and media act as mouthpieces propagating lies and falsehoods about China in massive smear campaigns. Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), both fabricated numerous Xinjiang-related lies, are typical examples of such ""lies manufacturers"". Adrian Zenz is a member of a far-right group founded by the US government and a key member of an anti-China research institute set up and manipulated by the US intelligence agency. His so-called reports on Xinjiang reflect no credibility, intellectual merit or academic integrity at all. As disclosed by the media, the US State Department and arms manufacturers are the primary foreign sponsors for the ASPI. Funding from the US State Department alone reached nearly 1.4 million Australian dollars a year, all directed to research projects attacking China. The ASPI disseminated a series of lies and disinformation on issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang and data security. In addition to constantly spreading disinformation on China, the US has also rolled out measures to suppress and contain China based on such disinformation, including China-related bills and sanctions. In December 2021, under the pretext of its so-called concerns on ""forced labor"", the US signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, imposing a full ban on imports from Xinjiang. This is a malicious move to denigrate human rights situation in Xinjiang, and a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations. China has used facts and figures to tell the truth and refute the lies and rumors created and propagated by the US. It is aimed at making truth heard, not spreading disinformation. Instead of observing basic facts, the US has acted in its own interests and labeled all views different from its own as ""disinformation"". This is, in essence, hegemony and bullying in the field of public opinion. Falsehood 14: China is circumventing or breaking trade rules and its economic manipulations have cost American workers millions of jobs, harming workers and companies in the United States but also around the world.The United States will push back on market-distorting policies and practices, like subsidies and market access barriers, which China's government has used for years to gain competitive advantage. Reality Check: China has faithfully delivered on its commitments made upon accession to the WTO. China upholds, builds and contributes to the multilateral trading system. China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial in nature. However, US' wanton suppression of China in trade and investment areas has been the root cause of trade frictions between the two countries, which hurts others without benefiting oneself. Over the past 20-plus years since joining the WTO, China has earnestly fulfilled its commitments upon accession. It has rolled out nationwide the management system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list, kept expanding market access, brought down overall tariff level from 15.3% to 7.4%, and opened up nearly 120 sectors in the service industry. In October 2021, the WTO conducted the eighth review of trade policies and practices of China. The report of the review fully recognized China's efforts in upholding the multilateral trading system and its active role in the WTO. It spoke highly of China's achievements in such areas as trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, greater opening-up and progress under the Belt and Road Initiative. A leading official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development pointed out that, over the past two decades, China has steadfastly supported the rules-based multilateral trading system, practiced true multilateralism, participated fully in WTO negotiations, steered negotiations in areas such as investment facilitation and e-commerce, and worked for WTO rules keeping pace with the times. Embracing the trend of regional and global economic integration, China has deepened economic and trade ties with countries around the world, signing free trade agreements and stepping up the building of free trade zones. As of now, China has signed 19 free trade agreements with 26 countries and regions. China has actively deepened supply-side structural reform. It has met the target of phasing out 150 million tons of overcapacity in the steel industry set out in the 13thFive-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, 1.14 times of the global total in slashing overcapacity of steels. The process involved the reemployment of 280,000 Chinese steel workers, more than the total number of steel workers in the US, Europe and Japan. China and the US have highly complementary economies, deeply integrated interests, and mutually beneficial economic and trade ties. In 2021, bilateral trade topped record-breaking 750 billion US dollars. The US Export Report 2022 issued by the US-China Business Council showed that, in 2021, goods exports to China grew by 21 percent to 149 billion US dollars, supporting 858,000 jobs in the US. The 2020 Annual Business Survey Report on Chinese Enterprises in the United States released by the China General Chamber of Commerce-USAindicated that,as of 2019, CGCC's Chinese member companiescumulatively invested over 123 billionUS dollars, employedmore than 220,000 people, and supported over onemillion jobs throughout the United States. Research of the US-China Business Council showed that Chinese exports have helped bring down US consumer price by 1 to 1.5percent, saving each US household 850 US dollars per year. By blaming China for its own economic problems, the US started a trade war and tariff war against China, which only backfired for itself. US tariffs against China have cost American companies more than 1.7 trillion US dollarsin market capitalizationand increased average household expenditure by 1,300 US dollars per year. A 2021 report by the US-China Business Council pointed out that the trade war with China has resulted in a loss of 245,000 jobs in the US. A report from Moody's Investor Service was cited as sayingthat American consumers bear 92.4 percentof the cost of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize laureate in economics, incisively pointed out that US trade policy toward China has failed and tariffs harm the US more than their intended targets. On 18 May 2022, the National Retail Federation (NRF) wrote to President Biden, calling for eliminating tariffs, which, as pointed out in the letter, could reduce consumer prices by as much as 1.3 percent. Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, said that sometariffs on China hurt American consumers and businesses, and that cutting tariffs was worth considering in order to lower US inflation. The obstacles to China-US economic and trade cooperation are mainly from the US side. Over 1,000 Chinese companies have been put on its lists for unfair suppression or sanction. The US Congress has put forth more than 300 negative China-related bills. The proposed Bipartisan Innovation Act, which is still being developed, essentially aims to hold back China's economic growth. The US arbitrarily accuses China of its industrial subsidy policies, but the country itself was among the first to develop such policies, including subsidies and so on. Successive US administrations have rolled out plans to support emerging industries. Through tax relief, government procurement and other means, the US administrations have interfered in the market to push forward cooperation between government and enterprises and advance technology transfers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the US undertook special programsto promote the development of its aerospace and military industries. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration supported the growth of hi-tech industries with the Information Superhighway plan. Such industrial policies are still being practiced in the US today. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the US and its allies and partners in Europe and Asia have increased subsidies to industries such as semiconductors, electric-car batteries and pharmaceuticals to shore up support for domestic companies. The US poses the biggest challenge to the global trading system. Following ""America First"" policy, the US has refused to shoulder its due obligations under multilateral trading agreements, and withdrawn from international treaties and organizations, taking a heavy toll on the development and functioning of the global trading system. A WTO dispute settlement report has identified the US as the biggest rule-breaker, responsible for two-thirds of violations of WTO rules.The US also blocked the appointment of new judges in the WTO Appellate Body, leading to an impasse in the Appellate Body since December 2019. Falsehood 15: The US will give countries an alternative choice, so that they can be free from opaque investments that leave them in debt. Reality Check: In providing foreign assistance, Chinaalways respectsthe sovereignty of recipient countries, attaches no strings whatsoever and pursues win-win outcomes. Chinese assistance has delivered real benefits to the relevant developing countries and received their acclaim and appreciation. The so-called Chinese ""debt trap"" is a narrative trap that the US and some other Western countries use to defame and smear China and disrupt China\'s cooperation with other developing countries. As a 2021 article in The Atlanticpoints out, the debt-trap narrative is just a lie fabricated by some Western politicians, and a powerful one. Western capital constitutes the largest creditor of developing countries. According to the 2022 statistics of the World Bank on international debt, 28.8 percent ofAfrica's outstandingexternal debtis owed to multilateral financial institutions and 41.8 percent to commercial creditors mainly composedof Western financial institutions. These two types of institutions togetherhold nearly three-quarters of the debt, making them the primary creditorsof Africa's debt. According to the director of the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at Johns Hopkins University of the US, after scrutinizing thousands of Chinese loan documents, mostly for projects in Africa, CARI has not found any evidence that China deliberately pushes poor countries into debt as a way of seizing their assets or gaining a greater say in their internal affairs. CARI's figures show that China holds 17 percent of Africa's overall external debt, far less than that of the West. Not a single African country has been forced to useits strategic resources such as ports or mines as collateral for financing cooperation with China. DW points out that the default of African countries does not give China the right to use the relevant infrastructure. The debt issue is, in essence, a developmentissue. The key to resolving this issue lies in ensuring that the loans deliver real benefits. Take Africa as an example. Western countries' financing for Africa is mainly concentrated in non-production fields, and most loans come with political strings attached, such as human rights and judicial reform. They have failed to truly promote economic development, boost government tax revenue and improve balance of payments. Rather, they have served asinstruments forcontrolling and causingharm inAfrica. China alwaysrespectsthe will of the African people and bearsin mind the actual needs of African countries. Chinese investment in and financing for Africa are mainly in infrastructure building and production-related fields. Enteringthe 21st century, China has worked actively to support Africa's economic developmentandprovided an alternative to the traditionalfinancing channelsofthe Paris Club. This has helped Africato strengthenitscapacity of self-generated and self-reliant developmentandto usher in a golden age of high-speedeconomic growth for 20 years straight. Professor Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University noted the diversification of Chinese investment. In 2014 alone, Chinese companies signed over 70 billion US dollars in construction contracts in Africa that will yield vital infrastructure, including hospitals, oil and gas pipelines, and airports. According to preliminary statistics, between 2000 and 2020, China helped African countries build more than 13,000 kilometers of roads and railway and more than 80 large-scale power facilities, funded more than 130 medical facilities, 45 sports venues and more than 170 schools, and trained more than 160,000 professionals across various fields for Africa. TheNairobi Expresswayproject built by Chinese companies in Kenyathrough public-private partnership has created more than 6,000 local jobs and benefited more than 200 subcontractors and several hundred local suppliers. The Kenyan government speaks highly of the project, commendingit as an important manifestation of the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between Kenya and China. Nigeria's Lekki Deep Sea Port project, built with Chinese participation, has provided more than 1,200 local jobs and is expected to create, directly and indirectly, 170,000 more upon completion. A study conducted by Hong Kong scholars finds that more than 80 percent of the employees of Chinese companies in Africa surveyed are local Africans. A team at the London School of Economics and Political Science finds that Chinese investment in Africa has produced ""significant and persistently positive long-term effects"". A study by RAND Corporation indicates that in the BRI region, having a rail connection between trading partners has improved total exports by 2.8 percent. China attaches high importance to the debt sustainability of projects. Back in 2017, it signed the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Roadwith 26 countries participating in the BRI. In 2019, China released the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative. Based on the debt situation and repayment ability of debtor countries, and following the principles of equal-footed consultation, compliance with laws and regulations, openness and transparency, the framework aims to strengthen monitoring and assessment of the economic, social and livelihood benefits of the projects, and channels sovereign loans into areas with high yields, with a view to ensuring the long-term returns of the projects. China has also made proactive efforts to lessen the burden of debtor countries. According to the World Bank, between 2008 and 2021, China provided 71 debt restructurings for low-income countries. In 2020, China actively responded to the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) by suspending the payment of more than 1.3 billion US dollars of debt that year alone, or nearly 30 percent of the G20's total, making it the largest contributor among G20 members. China has signed debt suspension agreements or reached mutual understanding on debt suspension with 19 African countries, and actively participated in the case-based debt settlement for Chad and Ethiopia under the G20's Common Framework. The US and some other Western countries, rather than taking actions themselves, point fingers at China for providing assistance. This has caused much displeasure among countries in the wider developing world. Professor Samita Hattige, adviserto the National Education Commission of Sri Lanka, saidin an interview with Global Times that Chinese loans are based on the needs of the Sri Lankan government and for the purpose of improving Sri Lankan infrastructure. The loans have brought major changes to Sri Lanka\'s economy and people\'s livelihood, and there is no such thing as a ""debt trap"". China\'s share in Sri Lanka\'s external debt is around a mere 10 percent. Apparently, some media have chosen to ignore this fact. While the ""Chinese debt trap"" hyped up by Western media seems apprehensible at a glance, it has deliberately evaded the huge economic values that infrastructure improvement has created, such as economic development and more jobs and investment. The article ""Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal Need China for Development"" published by Sri Lanka\'s Daily Newson 17 January 2022 says, ""South Asia needs China in its development process because China is synonymous with the term \'Development\'. China\'s ... Belt and Road Initiative provides benefits for almost all South Asian countries."" ""In the case of Sri Lanka,"" the article writes,""Sri Lanka is a beneficiary of Chinese projects. Many say only about the Chinese debt trap in this regard but no one mentions Chinese developmental activities in Sri Lanka."" ""They have invested heavily in seaports, airports, ... national highways, and power distribution centers. "" Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni stated in an interview with Nikkei in 2022 that ""Africa has been having (debt) problems for the last 600 years due to the slave trade, colonialism, neocolonialism  and none of it was from China."" ""China supported Africans\' fight against colonialism before starting economic activity on the continent."" Rwandan President Paul Kagame pointed out that China\'s presence in Africa is different from that of other countries  ""I don\'t think China has forced any country in Africa to take their money to accumulate the kind of debt you may find with some countries."" Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama stated that Nigeria had chosen Chinese companies for infrastructure projects because they were experienced and provide competitive rates. ""So the issue of Chinese influence really doesn\'t come in. Falsehood 16: For too long, Chinese companies have enjoyed far greater access to our markets than our companies have in China. American companies operating in China have been subject to systematic forced technology transfer, while Chinese companies in America have been protected by our rule of law. Reality Check: China is committed to fostering an enabling business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standard. While China's business environment keeps improving, the business environment for Chinese companies operating in the US continues to deteriorate. China has seen the most substantial improvement in business environment among all economies. In recent years, China has made continuous efforts to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, improved the institutions for investment promotion and protection and for information reporting, and stepped up intellectual property protection, becoming one of the most-improved economies for ease of doing business. With the continuous improvement in business environment and its super-sized domestic market, China is a strong magnet for cross-border investment from around the world. The number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises is on a steady rise in China. From 2012 to 2021, the number of foreign-invested enterprises in China increased from 441,000 to 664,000, up by over 50percent. According to the Doing Business 2020report released by the World Bank Group, China ranked 31st on ease of doing business, moving up by 47 spots in two years. The European Business in China Business Confidence Survey 2021released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) shows that a majority of the European companies surveyed found intellectual property rights enforcement to be ""adequate"" or ""excellent"" in China, marking a record high in satisfaction levels. It is the foreign companies, including the US companies operating in China, that can best tell whether China's business environment is good or not. The 2022 China Business Climate Survey Reportof the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) shows that 58 percent of the US companies in China saw their operating revenue growing in 2021; 66 percent of the companies plan to increase their investment in China this year; and China remains a top-three priority of the global investment planning for 60percentof the companies. The recently released USCBC 2021 Member Surveyshows that 95 percent of the respondents remained profitable in their China operations; and 74 percent of the companies took China as a top priority or a top-five priority market in their business strategy. In the first four months of 2022, the actual US investment in China rose by 53.2 percent year on year. These figures speak volume about the optimism of foreign companies in China's economic prospects, as well as their recognition of China's sound business environment and confidence in building a long-term business in the Chinese market. To preserve its hegemony and economic interests, the US has abused its national power in violation of the principles of market economy and international trade rules, and resorted to every possible means to suppress and contain Chinese enterprises. The US government has fabricated all sorts of lies including ""forced labor"" in an attempt to bring down Xinjiang\'s cotton, tomato and solar photovoltaic industries. According to preliminary statistics, in 2021, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued seven Withhold Release Orders (WROs) on the exports of goods made with ""forced labor"" to the US, including apparel, textiles, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and other goods made with cotton or tomatoes, silica-based products and electronic products produced in Xinjiang, and detained or confiscated 485 million US dollars worth of goods, which are notably larger in both quantity and value compared to 2020. The current US administration has already outperformed its predecessor in terms of the scale and magnitude of sanctions imposed on China for Xinjiang-related issues. The US has imposed sweeping restrictions on the financing and operation of Chinese enterprises in the US through non-transparent and unfair administrative means. According to official US statistics, the US has up to now put 1,055 Chinese entities and individuals (overseas affiliated entities excluded) on various types of sanctions lists, including 467 on the Entity List, 306 on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN), 201 on the Unverified List (UVL), 68 on the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List, and a few other entities. Last February, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) put WeChat and AliExpress on its latest Notorious Markets List, while Pinduoduo and other Chinese companies as well as nine physical markets located within China remained on the list. Falsehood 17: China takes advantage of the openness of the US economies to spy, to hack, to steal technology and know-how to advance China's military innovation, entrench its surveillance state and increase other countries' technological dependence. The US should make sure that technologies are rooted in democratic values. Reality check:China's technological innovation and development is based on its own investment and efforts. The US is drawing ideological lines inscientific and technologicalexchanges and cooperation, and this embodies its Cold War mentality. China is a big innovator in the world with leading input and growth rate in innovation. According to statistics, China's social R&D investment in 2021 reached 2.7864 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.2percentover the previous year. A total of 696,000 invention patents were authorized in 2021, up by 31.3 percent year-on-year. The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2021 published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that China's world innovation performance ranking has moved up from the 35th place to the 12th. China is now home to 19 of the top 100 science and technology clusters worldwide, ranking the second globally. Chinese applicants submitted 69,500 international patent applications, making China the first in the world for three consecutive years. The European Patent Office (EPO) recorded 16,665 applications from China in 2021, registering a year-on-year increase of 24 percent and the biggest surge among leading patent filing countries. In recent years, China has been actively integrating into the global science and technology innovation network,and has enjoyed fruitful results in technological and people-to-people exchanges under the BRI. In addition, China has also actively worked to join the Hague Agreement and the Marrakesh Treaty, contributing its shareto the global governance of intellectual property rights. The Business Confidence Survey 2021 publishedby the EUCCC shows that over half of interviewed companies view intellectual property rights enforcementin China as""adequate"" or ""excellent"". Throughout history, the US has repeatedly stolen intellectual properties and reaped dividends from technological developments through various means, including pryingoutinformation, offering immigration status and monopolizing patents. After World War II, the US launched Operation Paperclip to plunder Germany of its technology patents, including those on advanced aircraft and guided missile control. Nearly all German government agencies, research and development institutes and large companies were looted,and German scientists were forced to immigrate to the US. In the 1990s, US intelligence agencies installed eavesdropping devices in the cars of Japanese negotiators during automobile trade talks to intercept internal information and gain the upper hand in thenegotiations. In 2001, the European company Airbus sued the Americancompany Boeing for tracking Airbus employees' telephone, fax, and e-mails for business espionageusing the electronic surveillance system named Echelon developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA). In 2013, the US DOJ detained four Alstom executives to force the French company into a fire sale of its core business, power and grid, to the US company General Electric. In 2021, Danish media exposed that the US NSA wiretapped senior officials and business leaders in European countries using internet facilities located in Denmark. In addition, using ""chip shortages"" as an excuse, the US has also set deadlines to force leading chip makers from different countries to submit key information, including orders, clients and inventory, in an effort to turn the table in the chip sector. While claiming to uphold ""peace"" and ""openness"", the US has been wantonly setting up technological barriers, piecing together the so-called ""democratic technology alliance"", politicizing science and technology and turning them into ideological issues, and formingexclusive small circles. Identifyingnearly 20 categories as controlled critical technologies, including biotechnology and artificial intelligence, the US has tightenedup export control and investment scrutiny. It has also overstretchedthe concept of national security to contain and even stranglehold the development of high-tech industries in other countries, whichseverely violates the rights of developing countries in pursuing science and technology advancement. Falsehood 18: Climate is not about ideology. It's about math. If China sticks with its current plan and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the rest of the world must go to zero by 2035. And that's simply not possible. Reality Check:The US holds undeniable responsibilities for climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. It shouldn\'t shift responsibilities onto others, nor should it practice ""double standards"". Developed countries, due to their unconstrained emissions over more than two centuries of industrialization, bear undeniable historical responsibilities for climate change. From 1850 to 2011, developed countries contributed to 79 percent of global carbon emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement all require developed countries to repay their historical debts. From a historical perspective, developing countries are not the primary emitters of GHG, but the victims of climate change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance. As developed and developing countries do not bear the same historical responsibilities for climate change, and have different development needs and capabilities, it would be both inappropriate and unfair to apply the same restrictions on them. Wera Mori, Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea(PNG)said on the sidelines of COP26 that countries like PNG have become victims of climate change caused by the industrialization of developed countries and are now bearing the consequences of their actions, which is absolutely unfair. In tackling climate change, China is not just a responsible participant, but also a serious doer. President Xi Jinping committed explicitly that China will strive to peak CO2emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. That means China will move from carbon peak to neutrality in only 30 years, while the time the EU, the US and Japan give themselves is respectively 2.4, 1.4 and 1.2 times of China's. China has made notable contribution to the global efforts in energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and building, which are all in the range of 30 to 50 percent. By the end of 2020, China's CO2emissions per unit of GDP had dropped by 48.4 percent relative to the 2005 level. The proportion of coal in total energy consumption fell from 67 percent in 2005 to 56.8 percent in 2020. Thecumulativeinstalled capacity of renewable power generation exceeded 1 billion kilowatts, accounting for 43.5 percent of the national total. Chinese companies have taken 15 spots in the world's top 20 PV companies list, including all the top five spots, and seven spots in the top 10 wind power companies list. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of coal-fired power generation capacity, which is larger than the total installed power capacity of the UK. By the end of 2021, China's new energy vehicle ownership had exceeded 7.84 million units, and 2.95 million units were newly registered in 2021, accounting for 11.25 percent of all newly registered vehicles that year. The share of renewable energy in China's energy mix has already exceeded that of the US. By the end of 2019, the total installed capacity of China's hydro, wind and solar power generation had reached 756 million kilowatts, 2.8 times that of the US.Renewable energy accounts for 12.7 percent of China's primary energy consumption, approximately 1.4 times that of the US. The US is the world's largest GHG emitter in cumulative terms, and its per capita carbon emissions are 3.3 times that of the global average. In the 270 years from 1750 to 2019, the US emitted a cumulative 412.5 billion tons of GHG, accounting for about 1/4 of the global total. The US has produced the world's largest cumulative emissions, which are almost twice that of China's. Here are some statistics: the historical peak of US per capita GHG emissions was 23.44 tons; in 2018, US per capita emissions were 16.85 tons, while China's were 7.56 tons. Despite its status as a major manufacturing nation, China's current per capita carbon emissions are not even half that of the US, and its per capita cumulative emissions are only around 1/8 that of the US. Even by the time of 2030, when China's carbon emissions will have peaked, the country's per capita carbon emissions will still just be around 7-8 tons. In comparison, when the US had its carbon peak in 2005, its per capita carbon emissions had already reached 14 tons. In June 2017, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and in November 2020, it officially pulled out of the accord. Such a move seriously undermined the equity, efficiency and efficacy of global climate governance. The US had stayed outside the Paris Agreement until February 2021. Despite the improvement in political posture, the GHG emissions generated simply cannot be rolled back. Instead of cutting emissions, the US produced more emissions in 2021 than 2020, drifting further away from the course set by the Paris Agreement. With its flip-flopping on such an existential issue, the US has fully exposed its utilitarian approach to major issues of principles and lost its credibility in the family of nations. It is the unshirkable moral responsibility of developed countries to provide funding for developing countries to help them better cope with climate change. At Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancn in 2010, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing jointly 100 billion US dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. More than ten years have passed, developed countries have never truly delivered on their commitment. Report by a well-known international think tank shows that not only did developed countries fall short of their collective climate financing target every year, they also juggled the figures, providing far less funds than officially released figures. Most notably, the US only fulfilled less than 20percentof its due contribution. For years, the US has been saying publicly that it wants to work with China on climate change, but its actions say otherwise. While demanding China to consume less coal, it asks China to continue buying coal from it; while appealing for the development of renewable energies, it imposes sanctions on Chinese PV businesses. Take PV products as an example, starting from 2012, the US has imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese PV products, with rates as high as 34 to 47 percent. In December 2014, the US conducted anti-dumping and countervailing investigations on Chinese PV manufacturers. In January 2018, the previous US administration decided to slap global safeguard tariffs on 8.5 billion US dollars\' worth of solar panel imports. In late 2021, the so-called ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"" was signed into law by the US, which is yet another attempt to hobble the PV industry in Xinjiang under the disguise of human rights. Relevant US measures have not only impeded normal trade in PV products and disrupted normal supply chains, but also undermined global efforts in countering climate change. The US should correct its wrong practices in order to create an enabling environment for climate cooperation with China. Climate change has caused serious challenges to human survival and development, and must be tackled through global cooperation. Developed countries, the US included, should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and follow the requirements of the Paris Agreement. They need to face up to their historical responsibilities, and level up their ambitions and actions. They need to take the lead in making substantial reductions of emissions and strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. In the meantime, they need to give developing countries due space for development and emission, and deliver on their commitments of providing developing countries with adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support. On the basis of meeting financing pledges and leveraging public funds, efforts can be made to promote the development of green finance and bring private investment into low-carbon sectors. It is also important to build national, regional and global carbon markets and carbon pricing mechanisms, bring down the costs and raise the level of emissions reductions, promote technological innovation and sustainable development, and provide developing countries with stable sources of funding for mitigation and capacity-building through the benefit sharing mechanism of carbon markets. Falsehood 19:To counter illegal and illicit narcotics, especially synthetic opioids like fentanyl, we want to work with China to stop international drug trafficking organizations from getting precursor chemicals, many of which originate in China. Reality Check:The US has itself to blame for the root cause of fentanyl abuse in the country. Narcotics abuse, a chronic malaise plaguing the US, has deep historical and social roots. With five percent of the world's population, the US consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, making the country the world's biggest market for narcotics. There is a prevalent tradition of prescription painkiller abuse in the US, undergirded by a complete chain of pharmaceutical companies, medical representatives and doctors. All-out marketing by pharmaceutical companies, over-prescription by doctors, ineffective government crackdowns and the negative implications of marijuana legalization are among the combination of factors behind an ever-growing market for narcotics. Opioid abuse in the US and its rising toll started with OxyContin, an opioid painkiller made by Purdue Pharma and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995.When it comes to discouraging demand and curbing production, the US should have done a lot more. While the US has the most acute fentanyl challenge in the world, it is also the biggest producer and consumer of fentanyl and has yet to officially schedule fentanyl-related substancesasa class. Nevertheless, it kept demanding other countries to take actions. This is a typical example of ""forcingothers to take medicine for one\'s own illness"". The Chinese government takes a zero-tolerance approach to narcotics and strictly regulates anesthetics, psychotropic substances and their precursors. By the end of 2021, China has added 37 drug precursors and ephedrine-related substances to its control list, which became even longer than the UN list. China strictly regulates import and export of chemicals pursuant to international rules and its domestic laws, and its efforts and achievements in this regard are visible to all. On 1 May 2019, the Chinese government became the first country in the world to class schedule fentanyl-related substances, although there was no large-scale fentanyl abuse or immediate hazard in China. This is an important follow-up to the common understandings reached between the presidents of China and the US, and a concrete example of how China, keeping in mind the health, safety and well-being of humanity, actively responds to the US concern and helps it tackle its domestic opioid crisis. On 1 July 2021, China class scheduled allsynthetic cannabinoids and another 18 psychoactive substances including fluoroketamine. On 20 September of the same year, another six chemicals, including methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate (MAPA), were added as drug precursors. China is making continuous efforts to regulate precursors in accordance with law. China has taken a host of measures to crack down on the trafficking of fentanyl and other scheduled chemicals, like introducing real-name registration of senders and receivers, parcel examination and X-ray screening in the express delivery sector, andstepping up examination of cross-border parcels to certain destinations including the US. These measures have paid off. Afterclass scheduling fentanyl-related substances, China'sNational Narcotics Control Commission and Ministry of Public Security have maintainedclose, candid and in-depth coordination withtheir US counterparts including the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the State DepartmentBureau ofInternational Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs andthe Drug Enforcement Administration.Since September 2019, the US has not seized any fentanyl-related substances coming from China. The US has expressed appreciation to China on many occasions and noted drug control as a highlight in bilateral law enforcement cooperation. As is known to all, the responsibility to prevent the entry of non-scheduled chemicals and their use in illicit drug-making falls on the import country. The US, however, would neither officially schedule fentanyl nor address the issue of domestic consumption. Instead, it chose to shift the blame by falsely claiming that ""fentanyl precursors used by drug trafficking organizations originate in China"" and making an issue out of non-scheduled chemicals. This reflects an ulterior motive and an extreme lack of responsibility for the life and health of its own people. InMay 2020, without producingany evidence, the US addedtheInstituteof Forensic Science of China\'sMinistry of Public Security and the National Narcotics Laboratoryto its ""Entity List"". Such a practice of seeking China\'s cooperation on the one hand while imposing sanctions on China\'s narcotics control authorities has seriously hindered the operation of China\'s fentanyl monitoring systemand undermined the counter-narcotics cooperation between China and the US. While China and the rest of the world are tightening control over fentanyl-related substances, fentanyl-related problems are deteriorating in the US, causing a mounting death toll. It lays bare the US's failure to get to the crux of the fentanyl abuse problem. China has acted out of goodwill and repeatedly advised the US to follow effective practices widely recognized by the international community, like stepping up regulation on fentanyl prescription and promoting public awareness Falsehood 20:As a global food crisis threatens people worldwide, we look to China  a country that's achieved great things in agriculture  to help with a global response. Reality Check: The US has long been restricting grain exports and monopolizing grain trade. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US expanded its arms assistance and abused unilateral sanctions, further aggravating the global food shortage. It bears unshirkable responsibility for the global food crisis. The US-driven deglobalization, its grain-for-energy production policies and food oligopolies are the root causes of global food crisis. Using its status as a major grain-producer, the US has been restricting its grain exports to other countries, causing disruptions to normal global grain trade. The 12 major grain producers such as the US, Canada and the European Union accounts for 70percent of the world's total grain production and exportation. In global trade relations, the US and other Western countries weigh heavily on whether developing countries can buy grain and at what price. The US consumes grain to produce biofuels, straining global food supply, especially the supply of subsistence crops. Nearly one-third of the corn produced in the US is used for biofuels. Using grain as substitute for energy leads to fewer grain for global food supply, creating a vicious circle of food and energy prices pushing up each other. The four major grain suppliers ADM, Bunge and Cargilland Louis Dreyfus monopolize more than 80percent of the world's grain trade, and control global agricultural raw materials as well as grain production, processing and supply. These four grain suppliers, three from the US, manipulate the international prices of grain and earn extra profits from global food price volatility. Since 2021, their net income has increased by 53 percent, 80 percent, 64 percent and 47.7 percent respectively, and the stock prices of ADM and Bunge have nearly tripled. These international food oligopolies are profit-seeking, and they won't miss any opportunity to stir up food security issues and inflate food supply shortage to make bigger profits. The US has been stoking the flames in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and abusing economic sanctions. These have exacerbated global food shortage. The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a direct consequence of the constant instigation by the US and other Western countries. US military and arms assistance to Ukraine has increased to 53.6 billion US dollars, more than 70 percent of the combined military spending of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The longer and bigger the conflict is, the greater its impact on global food production and supply will be, and the food crisis will further intensify. In the face of a global food crisis, major grain-producing countries such as the US have instead kept their ""grain bags"" tight. According to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report released by the US Department of Agriculture this May, US wheat exports in 2021/22 will be 18.9 percent lower than the previous year. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the total amount of food exports affected by the restrictions has increased significantly, which now represents about 17 percent of total calories traded in the world The US food security initiative is more of empty words than concrete actions, only to fragment global food security governance. Russia is a major exporter of subsistence crops and the world's largest exporter of fertilizers. Since the US and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, the price index of various fertilizers has risen by more than 30 percent, which has seriously affected agricultural production. From 2021 to 2022, wheat and barley exports from Russia account for 16 percent and 12.9 percent of the world's total respectively. Statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) show that since the US imposed sanctions on Russia, the Food Price Index in May this year has risen by 14 percent compared with February. Serious food waste in the US has worsened the global food shortage. First, the amount of food waste is astounding. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the US, 30 to 40 percent of the food supply and 38 percent of grain products are never eaten each year. In 2018, the US had 103 million tons of its food wasted, worth 161 billion US dollars. In 2020, the country's food waste per capita was 59 kilograms. Second, distribution is uneven. About 38 million people are food insecure in the US in 2020, and the majority of them are African Americans, Latin Americans and Native Americans. According to National Geographic, more than one-third of the low-income households do not have access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program introduced by the US government, and its benefits fall short of helping many families in high-cost areas enjoy a healthy and adequate diet. Third, secondary problems are prominent. Every year, the overproduction of food in the US puts a staggering burden on the environment and wastes numerous resources, including over 9.3 million hectares of arable land, 22 trillion liters of water, 350 million kilograms of pesticides, and 6.35 million tons of chemical fertilizers. China has made significant contributions to global food security. It has supported one-fifth of the world's population with a quarter of the world's total food, on less than 9 percent of the world's arable land. The Global Development Initiative put forward by China has identified food security as one of the eight priority areas of cooperation. China will mobilize efforts from all parties across the globe to draw on each other's strength, and form the greatest synergy to meet all sustainable development goals including food security. This initiative has received positive response from more than 100 countries around the world and international organizations such as the UN. The Chinese people cherish food and keep to the traditional virtue of thrift. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to food security. He has called for thriftiness and opposes squandering, stressing on multiple occasions the need to stop food waste. Since the launch of the nationwide ""Clear Your Plate"" campaign in 2013, consumer food waste in China has been significantly reduced. According to the Nature magazine, the amount of food discarded by Chinese restaurants and eateries has decreased by 40 percent. In 2021, the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste hosted by China was well received by the international community, including members of the G20. China is an important strategic partner of FAO in South-South cooperation. In recent years, China has donated 130 million US dollars to the FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund. China has sent more than 1,100 agricultural experts and technical personnel to and trained nearly 100,000 farmers in more than 40 countries and regions. Under the framework of the FAO's South-South Cooperation Programme, China has donated the largest amount of fund, sent the most experts, and undertaken the most projects among all developing countries. China has provided its own solutions to global food shortage. Chinese hybrid rice is being grown in dozens of countries and regions in Asia, Africa and the Americas, with an annual growth area of eight million hectares. This increased the world\'s total grain output by 150 million tons, enough to feed 400 to 500 million more people. Yuan Longping, known as the ""Father of Chinese Hybrid Rice"", and other Chinese researchers have offered advice and counsel in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and many other countries. Through international training courses, China has trained over 14,000 hybrid rice technicians for more than 80 developing countries. Falsehood 21:Beijing has perfected mass surveillance and exported that technology to more than 80 countries. Reality Check:The US is the biggest empire of hacking. The use of video surveillanceand big data technology is an important step taken by the Chinese government to improve social governance, and also a common practice across the world. It is necessary, legal and justified. Tianwang (Skynet), which iscomposed of video surveillance systems,effectively eliminates potential risks to public security and ensuresthe high percentage of solved criminal cases in China. With the increasingly digitized crime prevention and control system, 98.6 percent of the people in Chinafelt safe in 2021, and China is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China ranked the thirdin the law and order index published by Gallup, aUS consulting company, while the US 36th. Statisticsshow that there were some 70 million cameras installed in the US in 2018, one for every 4.6 people.For the USto accuseChina of mass surveillance, it's just double standard at work. For a long time, the US has carried out large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber espionage, surveillance and attacks on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals in violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. In June 2013, the Guardian and the Washington Post reported that NSA has been running PRISM,a clandestine electronic surveillance program, since 2007, whose targets includeeven itsown allies. Der Spiegel reported that the US intelligence may have been monitoring the German Chancellor's mobile phone communications for nearly a decade. In 2020, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC)demanded Facebook to stop sending data of EU users to the US. The report comes just a few months after the European Court of Justice ruled the data transfer standard between the EU and the US doesn't adequately protect European citizen's privacyand concluded that EU citizens had no effective way to challenge US government surveillance. It is reported that US agencies such as NSA can theoretically ask internet companies like Facebook and Google to hand over data on an EU citizen and that EU citizen would be none-the-wiser. In December 2020, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Liberts (CNIL)of Francestated that google.fr and amazon.fr websites violated relevant French regulations by placing tracking cookies on their users' computers without obtaining prior consent and without providing adequate information. In 2021, Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) reported that between 2012 and 2014, NSA used information cables of Denmark to wiretap (spy on) senior officials of Sweden, Norway, France and Germany, including manypolitical dignitaries such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The US apparently broke its promise that it would stop wiretappingMerkel. The US abusesits leading position in internet and communication technologyandis truly an empire of hacking, tapping and theft of secrets. From PRISM, the Irritant Horn project, and Stellar Wind, to Operation Telescreen, the Hive platform and the QUANTUM attack system, the US has violated the freedom of communication and speechof its citizens through digital surveillance, and has engaged in cyber attacks, surveillance and thefts of secrets across the world. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden ofthe Stateroomprogram show that the US has covertly installed eavesdropping devices in nearly 100 of its embassies and consulates to steal secrets from their hostcountries. A report on APT-C-39released by Chinese cybersecurity company 360in 2020 reveals that APT-C-39, a hacking group under the CIA,has conducted cyberinfiltration attacks on China for 11 years targeting critical sectors includingaviation and aerospace, research institutions, oil industry, large internet companies, and government agencies. Such attacks have seriously undermined China's national securityandthe security of its economy, critical infrastructureas well aspersonal information of the general public. According to areport on the indiscriminate worldwide cyber attacks by NSA's APT-C-40 over the past decadereleased by 360 in 2022, NSA has attacked, usingcyber weapons,403 targets in 47 countries and regions worldwide, including China, the UK, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, India, the ROK, the UAE, South Africa and Brazil. On 19 April 2022, China\'s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) issued an alert on cyber attacks by the US government against other countries and released a related report. Itbrings to light ""Hive"", a lightweight cyber weapon used exclusively by the US government, and the fact that the US has deployed cyber attack platforms worldwide and has jumper servers and VPN channels in countries like France, Germany, Canada, Turkey and Malaysia.",[],[],2022-06-19 19:40,fmprc.gov.cn,"The article presents a series of claims and accusations against China, primarily from the perspective of the United States.

128,Renowned physicist given title of People's Scientist,"('Nobel',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202409\28\WS66f73ea6a310f1265a1c55d5.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/28/WS66f73ea6a310f1265a1c55d5.html,"Since the discovery of superconductivity in 1911, scientists have been pursuing answers to two key questions: finding superconducting materials with higher critical temperatures that are more suitable for applications, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of superconductivity. For the past 50 years, Zhao Zhongxian, physicist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has dedicated himself to the study of superconducting materials. Leading his team in the global superconductivity race for decades, Zhao achieved two significant milestones. One is discovering high-temperature superconducting materials in the 1980s and the other is synthesizing iron-based superconductors with critical temperatures above 50 K or  223 C, in 2008. These achievements have propelled China's high-temperature superconductivity research to the forefront of the international stage. As it approaches the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People\'s Republic of China, Zhao was awarded the national honorary title of""People\'s Scientist"" this month. This is the highest honor in China given to distinguished individuals who have made significant contributions and earned high reputations in various fields such as economy, defense, diplomacy and education. Superconductivity refers to the phenomenon where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled to a certain temperature. In other words, achieving a superconducting state requires an extremely low-temperature environment. Experts from the Institute of Physics at the CAS explain that low temperatures in physical research are typically achieved using liquid helium and liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen can only cool down to 77 K or  196 C, so for superconductors with critical temperatures below that, the much more expensive liquid helium must be used. This is why finding superconductors with higher critical temperatures has been a global research focus for physicists. In the 1960s, US physicist William L. McMillan calculated that the highest possible superconducting critical temperature was unlikely to exceed 40 K. His calculations were widely accepted by the international academic community, and 40 K became known as the ""McMillan limit"". However, Zhao and a few other international scientists challenged this view. In 1977, Zhao published a paper suggesting that the critical temperature could reach 40-55 K, and that complex structures and new mechanisms could potentially push it to 80 K in certain cases. In 1986, the first report of superconductivity at 35 K was made by European scientists J. Georg Bednorz and Alexander Muller, supporting Zhao's theory. They won the Nobel Prize for the achievement later. By the end of that year, Zhao's team surpassed the McMillan limit, discovering high-temperature superconductors above 40 K, with some even showing signs of superconductivity at 70 K. ""For a time, the global physics community was shaken, and the collapse of traditional theories brought\'Beijing\'s Zhao\' into the spotlight of renowned international physics journals,"" Zhang Xiaotian of the Yangtze River Delta Physics Research Center said. At that time, Zhao faced international skepticism because no other teams had achieved similar high-temperature superconductivity. Amid the doubts, Zhao and his team realized that their experimental samples, made from alloys produced by a factory that had been state-owned in 1956, contained impurities, which might have played a role. Inspired by this, they began to intentionally introduce impurities. After more than a month of countless experiments and adjustments, on the night of Feb 19, 1987, in a modest laboratory at the Institute of Physics, Zhao and his team finally developed the first superconducting material with a critical temperature of 93 K. Five days later, they announced its elemental composition to the world for the first time. The Nobel Prize in physics winner Bednorz noted, ""The research achievements of professor Zhao and his colleagues are remarkable, and we thank them for their important contributions to the advancement of world science and superconductivity research."" Zhao did not stop there. He continued his dedicated research for another 20 years, leading his team to synthesize iron-based superconductors above 50 K in 2008 and setting a world record with a bulk iron-based superconductor at 55 K. In Zhao's view, perseverance is crucial in scientific research. He believes that once you identify a direction in a field, sticking with it will eventually yield results. ""To use an analogy, we have many keys in our pockets and are constantly making new ones. Only one key can open the door to scientific discovery. Our task is to tirelessly create and modify each key until we unlock that door,"" Zhao said. ""Some keys may not open the door during experiments, leading some to give up. But who can be certain that the next key won\'t unravel the mysteries of the unknown?"" he said.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202409/28/66f73ea6a310f1268d81f592.jpeg'],['Zhao Zhongxian'],2024-09-28 07:24,Yan Dongjie,"- **Main Topics:**

The fast-evolving technology first made headlines in China almost a decade ago. In 2015, Swedish carmaker Volvo organized a test of its hands-free vehicles traveling at 70 kilometers per hour on Beijing's Sixth Ring Road. Chinese technology giant Baidu set up its intelligent driving group in 2017, unveiling its Apollo autonomous driving plan the same year. Pony.ai, founded by former Baidu engineers, established its first autonomous driving research and development center in 2016. By late February, more than 20 cities had put in place policies supporting autonomous driving tests, issuing licenses to over 60 companies. Progress had been generally going smoothly until July, when a short video went viral on social media of one of Baidu's Apollo Go driverless vehicles hitting a scooter in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. Baidu was quick to explain that the accident was because the scooter driver had run a red light when the driverless vehicle started to move. Despite the accident being a minor one, as shown in the footage, it ignited complaints from local drivers and residents. Apollo Go\'s Chinese name is Luobo Kuaipao, which literally means ""robots run fast"". But in Wuhan they are called ""dumb robots"", as more footage emerged showing their mishaps. One driverless vehicle is seen stopping on the road in front of an empty plastic bag, causing a traffic jam. In another video, two vehicles are seen braking to face each other, and not knowing what to do next.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202409/23/66f0a5c4a3103711c348b320.jpeg'],['A journalist takes a photo while riding in an autonomous vehicle in Chongqing in October.

The Thai fired a final-round 64, including 10 birdies, for a 19-under-par total of 269 at Hidden Grace Golf Club to finish comfortably ahead of second-placed Kho Tai-chi of Hong Kong, China. Kho sensationally chipped in for an eagle on the 18th for a 65, to tie for second place with Chinese youngster Chen Guxin, the third-round leader. Spain's Eugenio Chacarra, who led at the halfway mark, fired a 68 to finish a further shot back in outright fourth in the $1.5-million event being played on the Asian Tour for the first time since 2019 and part of the International Series. Suwannarut's task was made a lot easier on Sunday as his two nearest challengers  overnight leader Chen and amateur Ding Wenyi  produced disappointing final rounds, with both Chinese players carding 73s. ""I wanted to find something this week because it has been a tough year,"" said 25-year-old Suwannarut. ""I have missed a lot of cuts. I didn\'t finish good at all, but it happens. ""My putting this week was insane. It\'s like lights out. I feel like I saw every line, saw how to putt, saw everything."" He becomes the second Thai to win the China Open, after Prayad Marksaeng in 1996. The big-hitting Suwannarut also leapt from 85th to 12th on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. Chen birdied his final two holes and punched the air in delight on the 18th green when his birdie putt dropped in the cup. However, he later reflected on a wasted opportunity to win his home championship for the first time. ""Sarit\'s putting was extraordinary today,"" said Chen. ""He played very well and by contrast I just played badly. I need to learn how to play well in the final round."" Despite his frustration, Chen's tied-second finish was a boost in his bid retain his Asian Tour card for next year. The result saw him catapult from 115th to 40th place on the Order of Merit, with four events remaining. The top 65 players retain their playing privileges. Kho took full advantage of the perfect scoring conditions and immaculate greens on Sunday to shoot a seven-under 65  which included an eagle two from 20 yards (18 meters) at the 18th  to finish tied second with Chen at 13-under. ""Walking up to that chip I was saying to my caddie that I have to do a better job with my short game; to just trust it and let go,"" said Kho of his eagle at the last. ""I was able to let go on the chip  it was a really good chip and it looked good all the way. I was really happy to cap off the week like that."" Second-round leader Eugenio Chacarra of Spain posted a final-round 68 to finish alone in fourth place while England's Steve Lewton also made an eagle two at the last for a 67. Lewton finished the event in tied-fifth place with India's Karandeep Kochhar, who matched the winner's final-round score of 64 on Sunday. Despite making an eagle and three birdies on Sunday, Ding had to settle for tied-seventh after a triple bogey on the 16th scuppered his title chances as he claimed the amateur prize. Also finishing in seventh place alongside Ding was pre-tournament favorite Andy Ogletree of the United States. Former Ryder Cup player Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland completed his week with a one-under 71 that left him in joint 13th place.

New quality productive forces might be related to and shaped by scientific breakthroughs, said Liu Cixin, when asked about his understanding of this concept that is key to China's economic development at the launch ceremony of a celebratory week of sci-fi events in his hometown of Yangquan in Shanxi province on Oct 13. Liu, born in Beijing, moved with his parents to Yangquan when he was a child. At 22, he started working at the Niangziguan Power Plant in Shanxi. In June 1999, he published his first short stories including The Whale's Song in Science Fiction World magazine. In 2006, his novel The Three-Body Problem was serialized in the magazine. A representative of sci-fi in contemporary China, Liu, 61, has written 40 short stories and seven novels, including the best-selling novels The Three-Body Trilogy, Ball Lightning and Supernova Era and short stories such as The Wandering Earth , Time Migration and The Village Teacher . In 2015, The Three-Body Problem, the first volume of The Three-Body Trilogy, translated by Ken Liu, won the Hugo Award for best novel at the 73rd World Science Fiction Convention, making Liu the first Asian to receive this award. So far, the trilogy has been translated into 35 languages, selling more than 4 million copies overseas. At the ceremony, he said, ""Artificial intelligence might exert great influence on productive forces, boosting them  or a more complicated influence."" Liu cited the 2024 Nobel Prize winners for chemistry for example, of whom Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded for the AI model they created that fundamentally changes the way a protein\'s structure is studied. He said that, in the past, it might have taken scientists years to crack one protein\'s structure, but AI can crack nine proteins within one second, which is what is called new quality productive forces. ""It\'s a shocking leap. Its biggest meaning is that it changes ways of doing scientific studies and also our ways to learn the laws of the cosmos and nature,"" he says. Another technology that comes out of sci-fi works is self-driving technology, he says. In Wuhan, Hubei province, Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi service has raised concern among taxi drivers. When a new technology replaces an old one, it will always cause fluctuations, Liu said. For instance, at the start of the 19th century, the Luddite Movement took place in Britain, in which organized British workers destroyed the textile machinery that was displacing them, he said. ""Now we are facing a similar historical turning point. But if we can make the right choices, we can usher in a brand-new era of new quality productive forces,"" he said. Liu's works have been adapted into movies, TV series and comic books, including the movie adaptations of The Wandering Earth in 2019 and The Wandering Earth II in 2023, and two TV drama adaptations of The Three-Body Problem , released by Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video and the United States' Netflix.

Paper used in academic journals and dot matrix printer paper is close to this thickness. When such paper was picked up using artificial fingers, it caused a cut once every five attempts. In contrast, common A4 printer paper is about 100 micrometers thick. The experiment conducted by Kaare H. Jensen and his team was reported by British media in June. The scientists used papers with thicknesses ranging from 30 to 220 micrometers, cutting artificial fingers made from ballistic gel at different angles repeatedly. Ballistic gel, primarily composed of animal protein, effectively simulates the toughness of human skin. To commend the curiosity and inquisitive spirit of Jensen and his team, the 2024 Pineapple Science Award, guided by the Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology and hosted by the Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum, awarded them the Physics Prize in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province. The Pineapple Science Award is a public science communication event that has been held annually since 2012, aiming to encourage curiosity with scientific, educational and entertaining popular science content and forms. Organizers solicit imaginative scientific research findings and events, and a jury of scientists selects 10 winning projects, according to the organizing committee. To date, five Nobel laureates and more than a dozen academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering have attended the event. This year's Award of Scientific Event was given to Zhao Qi from the Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS and Deng Lixing from Deqing, Zhejiang. In July, Deng posted on social media that an apple she left on her windowsill had sprouted a white mushroom from its stem. Xu Rongju, a doctoral student who was a member of Zhao's team, saw the mushroom and sent a private message to Deng, hoping to purchase the apple for research. ""The mushroom-growing apple was useless to me, so I decided I might as well do a good deed and give it to scientists for research, letting the apple mushroom go to someone who can use it,"" Deng said. Xu said that based on online images, the apple had sprouted a split gill mushroom, a well-known edible fungus in Southeast Asia. ""In order to reproduce, split gill widely disperses its spores, and with the influence of atmospheric circulation, it is distributed worldwide. As long as the humidity is suitable, it will seize the opportunity to reproduce,"" Xu said. The fact that this strain grew so robustly on minimal substrate can provide a reference for the future breeding of split gill strains, he added. ""China is one of the most advanced countries in the mushroom industry. We are the only lab in the world that has sent mushrooms to space, so we should do these things even better,"" Xu said. A month later, the first batch of offspring from the apple mushroom was obtained through isolation and cultivation. Researchers sent some of the cultivated split gill back to Deng for tasting. By September, Zhao's team had received 18 types of split gill mushrooms from 12 different locations. Another award went to a team led by Jiang Lei, an academician of the CAS who discovered from a microscopic perspective that different alcohol concentrations and mixtures of ethanol and water form different molecular structures, making icy beer taste better. yandongjie@chinadaily.com.cn",[],[],2024-11-25 08:59,YAN DONGJIE,"- **Main Topics:**

The military said that Mushtaha was the ""right-hand man and one of the closest associates"" of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, and was considered the most senior figure in the Hamas political bureau. Sameh al-Siraj, who held the security portfolio in Hamas's political bureau and Labor Committee, and Sami Oudeh, commander of Hamas's General Security Mechanism, were also killed, it said. Israeli warplanes struck and killed the three while they were taking shelter in ""a fortified and equipped underground compound in the northern Gaza Strip,"" it added. Hamas has not confirmed the deaths of the three officials. Israel has vowed to kill all persons involved in Hamas's attack on Israeli communities last October, which killed about 1,200 people.

Regardless of her result in a slalom in Austria next week, Shiffrin could reach the milestone in two races in Killington, Vermont, on Nov 30 and Dec 1, respectively. The two-time Olympic champion, who is from Colorado, can almost consider Killington a hometown race, because she honed her skills nearby at the Burke Mountain Academy as a teenager. On Saturday, Shiffrin dominated the first women's World Cup slalom of the season for her 98th win. No other skier, male of female, has won more than 86 races. ""Amazing way to start the slalom season, I\'m super happy,"" the American said. Shiffrin built on a big first-run lead with an aggressive, yet controlled, second run down the Levi Black course to beat 2021 slalom world champion Katharina Liensberger of Austria by 0.79 seconds. Lena Durr of Germany dropped from second to third, 0.83 behind Shiffrin, and was the last skier to finish less than a second off the lead. Croatian prodigy Zrinka Ljutic, who was third after the opening run, lost three spots. Olympic champion Petra Vlhova, Shiffrin's biggest rival in slalom, sat out the race as the Slovakian needed more time to recover from last season's knee surgery. Shiffrin also led the season-opening giant slalom in Austria three weeks ago, but squandered that advantage in the second run to finish fifth. On Saturday, Shiffrin initially extended her lead to a massive 1.25 seconds early in her final run before losing a few tenths. ""I was getting twisted sometimes, but then kept fighting. Not the perfect tempo, but enough really good turns that it worked really well. In the end, a really solid run in conditions that were not so easy,"" she said. ""From this weekend, I am racing every single weekend until the world championships (in February), for sure. So, it\'s going to be a really big push now, and I was a little bit off on my mentality in Solden, so hopefully I can bring the GS under control. But, it was very important to start with a good place in slalom."" Shiffrin has triumphed in the last five slaloms she competed in. She won both races at the end of last season after her return from a knee injury following a downhill crash in January, clinching her eighth World Cup season title in the discipline. Shiffrin has triumphed a record eight times in the traditional season-opening slalom in Finnish Lapland, where the winner is given a reindeer as a prize. No skier other than Shiffrin or Vlhova has won the race since 2014, when then overall champion Tina Maze triumphed. Asked about a name for her reindeer, Shiffrin said she would ""check with the team and my teammates and see what everybody says"". Shiffrin positioned herself for victory with a convincing opening run, in which she posted the fastest split times in three of the four sections. ""I felt strong and solid, and a good energy. Little bit nervous, it\'s the first race, first slalom of the season, so I\'m happy with how I managed the mentality and pushed with my skiing,"" she said. Lindsey Vonn, who this week announced her return to the US ski team more than five years after her retirement, was expected to start racing again at speed events later this season. A men's slalom on the same hill is scheduled for Sunday. The women's World Cup is set to continue with another slalom in Gurgl, Austria, on Saturday.

""But, in the end, I kept pushing forward, just stayed on top of it and pushed to the finish. I find it to be really challenging in these conditions to find the right setup and feel like you can unleash the skis."" Shiffrin admitted to being ""really nervous at the top"" before the start of her second run. ""I wasn\'t sure how I was going to feel with the surface. It was getting darker. Sometimes, when I am not sure about the feeling under my feet, then I take too much time to make the turn,"" she said. ""I could hear all the women going down and their teams were cheering, and that always means they had a really good run,"" said Shiffrin, adding she didn\'t ""think it\'s happening today"".

Trump\'s ""America First"" policy and unpredictable approach toward dealing with external relations, especially with China, caused significant economic disruption during his first term as president of the United States. In a world facing unprecedented, chronic challenges  from economic instability, regional conflicts and climate change to transnational crime  the significance of US-China relations cannot be overstated. Instead of indulging in intense rivalry that puts global progress at risk, the two largest economic powers should focus on building a win-win partnership. By leveraging their historical ties and shared interests, the US and China can foster stability and prosperity not only for themselves, but for the entire world. This is why recent positive signals from China, particularly President Xi Jinping's message of mutual respect and cooperation, are welcome and reassuring. The history of US-China relations is not solely defined by competition. There have been key moments of collaboration, especially during past global crises. During World War II, the famous Flying Tigers  three squadrons of American pilots who volunteered to defend China against Japanese aggression  symbolized early military cooperation. Before that, during World War I, about 140,000 Chinese laborers assisted the Allied powers' military forces in Europe, laying the groundwork for a relationship that transcended borders. Cultural and educational exchanges between the two countries also contributed to close ties. Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen was educated at Oahu College  later renamed Punahou School  in Hawaii, the same institution where former US president Barack Obama studied. Sun Yat-sen's wife Soong Ching Ling too was educated in the US, showcasing the two nations' past dynamic cultural exchanges. Chinese martial arts superstar Bruce Lee, born in San Francisco, California, and prominent Americans, like Nobel Prize-winning author Pearl S. Buck, who captured the essence of Chinese life in her books, both reflected the rich personal and cultural interconnections between the two societies. The dynamic economic ties between the US and China are crucial for the global economy's stability. Elon Musk's Tesla, for example, has a major factory in Shanghai, similar to Apple Inc, which relies heavily on China and over 1 million Chinese workers contribute to the company's supply chain. Companies like Starbucks and Walmart have vast consumer bases in China. At the same time, many US entrepreneurs and tech leaders recognize the importance of understanding China. The interdependence of the two economies highlights the mutual benefits of collaboration, especially in the realms of trade, technology and job creation. US-China relations matter for several major reasons: Trade between the US and China anchors the global economy. A breakdown in their relationship has the power to disrupt supply chains and send shock waves through international markets. As the world's largest carbon emitters, the US and China must lead the fight against climate change. Their cooperation in the fields of green technology and emissions reduction is crucial for global sustainability. Both countries are at the forefront of technological advancements, from artificial intelligence to renewable energy. Collaboration in these fields can accelerate global progress and innovation. Relations between the two countries have a direct bearing on world peace and security. From the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea and the Middle East to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, US-China cooperation is essential for advancing regional and global peace. The two nations must realize that building stronger ties through student and intellectual exchanges fosters mutual understanding and helps bridge cultural divides. In the area of global health, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of international collaboration. Joint efforts by the US and Chinese scientists are key to combating future health crises. Last but not least, US-China dialogue is critical for ensuring the functionality of international institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, which are essential for maintaining global order. President Xi's remark that China-US cooperation will benefit not only the two countries but the world at large is a call to move beyond the zero-sum mentality that has often plagued this relationship. Both nations must recognize that their success is inextricably linked. The US should see China's resurgence not as a threat but as a natural revival of a once-great civilization that led the world in trade, innovation and culture, but did not have a history of colonial military conquests. Policymakers in Washington would do better to temper their seemingly irrational visceral biases against and feeling of ""existential insecurity"" about China\'s rejuvenation. Similarly, China can seek to cooperate with the US in many areas, reminding each other of the benefits of partnership. This is not just about economics or geopolitics  it\'s about shared global responsibility. The future of the US-China relationship is a matter of paramount global significance. By moving past narrow-minded concepts of strategic competition or rivalry and focusing on expansive cooperation, the two nations can unlock tremendous potential for themselves and the world. The world stands to benefit if both countries can continuously build mutual trust with words and sincere actions, and embrace mutual respect and shared goals. China and the US should ideally work together to help shape a more stable, prosperous and peaceful future for all.

At its core, the BRI embodies the wisdom of fostering connections between diverse nations, encouraging collaborative economic growth, and addressing mutual challenges through shared technology and infrastructure projects. In principle, the initiative's emphasis on inclusivity and balance is evident in its goal to create a community with a shared future for mankind. This vision extends beyond mere economic cooperation. It aspires to interlink trade routes, enhance technological prowess and build economic partnerships that benefit all parties involved. By focusing on sharing the know-how rather than merely exporting technologies, the BRI aims to empower nations, particularly those traditionally marginalized in the global economy, to achieve sustainable development through capacity-building and knowledge transfer. This thinking, when combined with learning, will be different from the principle that we have seen in all these years. Despite its principled aspirations, the BRI has faced significant resistance in the form of criticism, especially from leading Western publications such as The Economist, the Financial Times and Foreign Affairs. An analysis of 500 articles from four leading English magazines between 2013 and 2023 shows that negative sentiments embedded into variegated writings have increased as the BRI approached its 10th anniversary. Political magazines tend to focus on the geopolitical ramifications of the BRI innovation, and its critics argue that the initiative is a strategic move to extend China's influence across continents, potentially reshaping global power dynamics and challenging existing institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They have diffused an impactful concept called the ""debt trap"", which has been a recurring theme in Western media narratives. Skeptics assert that the BRI\'s financing mechanisms could burden participating countries with unsustainable debts, compromising their sovereignty. However, the facts are that the BRI is focused on helping countries and regions with access to technology, resources and distribution. Economist Amartya Sen was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics because he explained that India was not poor in resources but the absence of infrastructure and flow of resources are keeping it poor. If such links are good for the Western world and they are good for India, then they should be good for the nations that have subscribed to the BRI's benefits. Western critics have often overlooked China\'s genuine developmental goals and efforts to foster regional stability and prosperity. Because Western capitalism is based on ""capital above the human well-being"", they are unable to see that the BRI offers much-needed infrastructure development and economic opportunities to countries that have long been neglected by traditional Western-led financial institutions because of their transaction principles to transform host countries\' cultures and ideologies. Then there are some environmental critiques, with apprehensions about the impact of large-scale infrastructure projects on fragile ecosystems. Western media outlets have questioned whether China's environmental commitments are consistently upheld, pointing to the carbon footprint associated with the Belt and Road construction projects. In response, China has increasingly argued that it has incorporated sustainability as a fundamental component of the initiative. Efforts to align projects with environmental standards and invest in green infrastructure reflect an intention to balance development with ecological responsibility. While these measures indicate progress, critics emphasize the need for greater transparency and consistent implementation across all projects. Despite such criticism, there are tangible examples that highlight that the BRI's positive impact goes beyond physical infrastructure to digital infrastructure to alleviate the burden of carbon emissions. The recent high technology exhibition in Dubai displayed China's growing role in supporting Middle Eastern countries' desire to diversify their economies beyond oil and building a digital future. Chinese technological companies are leading projects to develop local tech talents and infrastructure, demonstrating the initiative's potential to foster innovation and economic diversification. This divergence in perspectives underscores a broader issue: the lack of understanding and, at times, misrepresentation of China's intentions in Western narratives. The tendency to view the Belt and Road projects through a prism of skepticism and protectionism can lead to missed opportunities for collaboration and mutual benefit for all. The exclusivity in the Western version of capitalism benefits a few at the cost of most others. History has shown that nations often prosper together through promoting openness and cooperation rather than isolation and protectionism. Contrary to the negative sentiments of the Western media toward the BRI's intended goals, the developing nations participating in the initiative generally exhibit a more positive stance, appreciating the opportunities for infrastructure improvement, industrial growth, cultural exchange and employment. An analysis of the narratives and rhetoric in news articles during the last 10 years shows that this disparity in perceptions reflects varying economic needs and political perspectives across global landscapes. For many of these countries in the developing world, the BRI represents not just an economic venture but a visionary statement underscoring global development and collective well-being. The bridging rather than buffering in inter-country relationships toward the narrative of mutual understanding is the desire of the initiative's partners. One can easily go beyond the concept of the assumption of ""an instrument of dominance and hegemony"", as promulgated by the leading Western media to serve some specific interest. Instead, it is an instrument of collective well-being. The BRI\'s portrayal in the Western media reveals the unnecessary, unvalidated and uncalled-for apprehensions of the United States and its partners. As the BRI continues to expand and evolve, mutual understanding and balanced narratives become crucial. The initiative's potential as a driver of global well-being hinges on its ability to foster inclusive growth and sustainable development. It is ignorance of the highest level if someone assumes there will be no natural challenges such as pandemics, weather anomalies and earthquakes or human-made challenges such as negative sentiments and resistance to change. Every innovative activity may be viewed as a threat to the existing systems, and biased Western critics always see it through the prism of fear, risk and threat regardless of how beneficial something new is to the overall socioeconomic well-being. Thus, the initiative will face even stronger resistance in the times to come, but it will not be able to stop its expansion because the opposite wind is necessary for any type of flight. By embracing openness and cooperation, the BRI has the potential to become a cornerstone of global progress in the 21st century.

With a focused expression and her blonde ponytail peeking out from under her helmet, Sirvio set off down a half-pipe on her skateboard, seconds later she spun around in the air while grabbing her board before sticking the landing with ease. ""I am really stoked to be able to represent my country and hopefully make them proud,"" the young skateboarder said during a break between training sessions at a skatepark in the Finnish city of Tampere. The visit to her native Finland was only a short pit stop for Sirvio, who lives in California and who has spent a lot of time traveling in recent years. Less than a month before the Olympic Games  which will be held in Paris from July 26 to Aug 11  Sirvio made a stop in Tampere for the Finnish skateboarding championships, after which the family planned on heading to a skatepark in southern Sweden for more training. ""We have been pretty much living on the road for the past two years,"" her father Fredrik Sirvio said. Jumping from training sites to Olympic qualifiers around the globe, the entire family has been fully devoted to Sirvio's Olympic pursuits. ""Eat breakfast, go to the skatepark, have lunch, come back, have a little rest and swim in the lake and back to the skatepark,"" he said, summing up the day\'s itinerary. Now competing as one of the world's top skateboarders, Sirvio first stepped on a skateboard only four years ago. Lockdown activity The family moved to Australia in 2020 to escape Finland's cold and dark winter months. Feeling bored indoors during pandemic-enforced lockdowns, Sirvio's little sister Miila spotted their dad's skateboard in the house and suggested the sisters try out the skatepark. ""We started to pick it up and it was really fun, and from then I have just been skating,"" said Sirvio, who is still accompanied by her 10-year-old sister at the skatepark every day. ""As parents, we have to tell the girls every once in a while that is a good time to take a day off and do something else other than skateboarding,"" their father said with a laugh. When Sirvio found success in local competitions and the Australian championships  considered one of the world's top skateboarding tournaments  it sparked a dream of the Olympics. A real possibility Being a former professional snowboarder, her father realized there was a real possibility that Sirvio could qualify for the Olympics if she continued progressing. ""These things do not happen many times in your lifetime, so we decided \'let\'s do it and give it all we have\',"" he said. Leaving their Australian home in Brisbane behind, the family of four began traveling to competitions all over the world, and sought out the best training sites. They established a new home base in California  the birthplace of skateboarding. ""In California, Heili skates and meets with some of the world\'s living skateboard legends,"" her father explained. Homeschooling and managing work remotely enable the lifestyle: usually the sisters study in the mornings and then skateboard the rest of the day. Ranked 14th of the 22 selected athletes in the women's park event, Sirvio will skate on a course consisting of bowls and bends at Place de la Concorde on Aug 6. ""Hopefully we bring home a medal from the Olympics, that would mean a lot to me,"" she said with a smile.

Eriksen's 35th-minute blast put United ahead, but the Danish midfielder gifted Twente its second-half equalizer at Old Trafford. Sam Lammers dispossessed Eriksen, who had made a risky turn under pressure, and fired past Andre Onana in the 68th minute. United manager Ten Hag refused to single out Eriksen, instead insisting the whole team had to take responsibility for its failure to hold onto the lead. ""We kept them alive, 1-0 up, controlling the game, you have to be consistent and keep going. ""In the second half we dropped the level, gave the goal away,"" Ten Hag said. ""We didn\'t finish it off, we had to go for the second goal, and so they stay alive and we get punished with a mistake from ourselves."" Pressed on Eriksen\'s blunder, Ten Hag added: ""The goal is (a) team (mistake), a player of Twente can dribble through the pitch without stopping. We can\'t give a goal away like this. ""We have seen again that you have to keep going for the whole game. ""Once you go 1-0 up you have to keep going, go for the second. It\'s the first game, it\'s very important you get a win."" Ten Hag spent a combined 23 years at Twente across three stints as a player, and then in different coaching capacities, saying on the eve of the game: ""It\'s not nice to have to hurt something you love."" Instead, it was the Eredivisie side who inflicted the discomfort, with a helping hand from another inconsistent United performance, which comes hot on the heels of a disappointing goalless draw at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Eriksen questioned whether United played with enough desire after its poor run in European competitions extended to one win in nine games. ""I think (we\'re) mostly disappointed as a team. We wanted more in the end, (it was) far from good enough. They looked like they wanted it more, that can\'t be right,"" Eriksen said. ""I think everyone is looking at themselves, everyone is a professional footballer, they know what to do, what can\'t happen. We didn\'t lose, but it feels like a loss."" After finishing bottom of its Champions League group with only one win last season, it was another dispiriting start to European action for United. Ten Hag's spluttering team is back in action against Tottenham at Old Trafford on Sunday. In the revamped Europa League first stage, it next faces Porto before a clash with Fenerbahce, managed by former United boss Jose Mourinho. Strong side Ten Hag selected a strong side to take on his former club. Marcus Rashford returned to the lineup after coming off the bench at Crystal Palace on Saturday, with Harry Maguire replacing Matthijs de Ligt in defense and Manuel Ugarte taking the place of Kobbie Mainoo. United had an early let-off when Lammers dragged the ball narrowly wide, after some slack play by Diogo Dalot, before Twente goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall pulled off a brilliant save to stop Mees Hilgers from turning the ball into his own net. He was well beaten, though, by Eriksen's thunderbolt, after the ball broke to the midfielder inside the Twente area. Onana turned Sem Steijn's low freekick around the post close to the hour mark, but Twente drew level when former Rangers forward Lammers dispossessed Eriksen after Bart van Rooij's marauding run into the United half, galloping clear to fire home. Unnerstall tipped Joshua Zirkzee's stinging effort over the crossbar and Bruno Fernandes went close, with Unnerstall producing a magnificent reflex save in stoppage time to keep out a Maguire header that deflected off Gijs Besselink. Porto, the 2003 and 2011 winner of the second-tier European competition, lost 3-2 away to Norwegian champion Bodo Glimt, which played most of the second half with 10 men. Ruben van Bommel, the son of former Netherlands international Mark, scored twice for AZ Alkmaar in a 3-2 victory over Swedish side Elfsborg, with ex-Tottenham forward Troy Parrott netting the winner from the spot. Mauro Icardi's last-gasp goal sealed a 3-1 win for Galatasaray over PAOK in Istanbul, while Nice was left to rue a missed penalty in its 1-1 draw against Real Sociedad.

Suwannarut's task was made all the easier on Sunday as his two nearest challengers  overnight leader Chen Guxin and amateur compatriot Ding Wenyi, both carded disappointing final rounds of one over par 73. ""I wanted to find something this week because it has been a tough year,"" said 25-year-old Suwannarut. ""I have missed a lot of cuts. I didn\'t finish well at all, but it happens.

Chen birdied his final two holes and punched the air in delight on the 18th green when his birdie putt dropped in the cup, however, he will reflect on a wasted golden opportunity to win his Nation Open Championship for the very first time. ""Sarit\'s putting was extraordinary today,"" said a disappointed Chen. ""He played very well and by contrast, I just played badly. I need to learn how to play well in the final round."" Hong Kong's Kho Tai-chi took full advantage of the perfect scoring conditions and immaculate greens to shoot a seven under par final round of 65  which included a chip in eagle two from 20 yards at the shortened par four 18th hole to finish in joint second place with Chen at 13 under par. ""Walking up to that chip I was saying to my caddie that I have to do a better job with my short game; to just trust it and let go,"" said Kho of his eagle at the last. ""I was able to let go of the chip  it was a really good chip and it looked good all the way. I was really happy to cap off the week like that.""

Ding had to settle for joint seventh place despite finishing eagle, birdie, however a triple bogey six on the 16th destroyed any hopes he had of a higher finish, but once again he claimed the low amateur prize. Also finishing in seventh place alongside Ding was Lee Chieh-po of Chinese Taipei and pre-tournament favorite Andy Ogletree of the US.

151,The US and EU tariff war on China is destructive on a whole new level,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202410\25\WS671af8b2a310f1265a1c9969.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/25/WS671af8b2a310f1265a1c9969.html,"President Joe Biden imposed tariffs on many Chinese products in May this year, including electric cars and solar panels. In Europe, this approach has been hugely critiqued for being bad for the environment and even furthering the effects of global warming. The EU has retried its former position, probably because of pressure from the US. There are two significant elements here that are stupid beyond belief: Cars are responsible for 48% of global carbon dioxide emissions and 61% of emissions in the European Union. Hence, we have a dire need for affordable electric cars. Tesla and other Western brands are not affordable to the ordinary person, especially not cars made for families. China offers quality electric cars at affordable prices. When it comes to many components in the electronic industry and the automobile industry specifically, the price of manufacturing those components at the same quality that China can produce them would be costly and make business ventures almost impossible in the long run. The Chinese societal system allows workers to live decent lives on much lower wages than in the West. For this to be theoretically possible, the West would need to drop the workers' salaries and expect them to work pretty much pro bono, or they would have to rearrange nearly all of the Western economic model and try to emulate the Chinese model. Neither is plausible. When the Russia-Ukraine war began, there was much discussion regarding sanctions against Russia. Many members of the European Parliament who otherwise voted for sanctions thought that the EU would need to make an exception for products and services that are crucial for the environment due to the environmental crisis we are facing. China is way more important than Russia in terms of technology and economy. So why are politicians not thinking clearly in this case? Cooperation with China will benefit people in general more than conflict. The more people can afford electric cars, the less pollution and carbon emissions we will have. Today, cars are the largest single emission source. Fighting climate change is, of course, in everyone's favor. Easier to produce goods at a much cheaper price. China can make cheap products and components and deliver them of excellent quality! This combination is vital, especially in electronics and cars, China's cutting-edge industry. The Western economy is already strained. Making it impossible for Chinese companies to do business in Europe will cost tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people their jobs. All in all, tariffs and/or bans on Chinese products will not only be counterproductive for the countries imposing those sanctions but also for the whole world and the environment our Western leaders claim to protect.

Jumper in London for ""protein structure prediction"". There is no disputing the fact that they have made amazing breakthroughs. The Nobel Prize committee remarked that ""they cracked the code for proteins\' amazing structures"". What rallied global attention is the fact that both Hassabis and Jumper come from Google DeepMind, which specializes in artificial intelligence, and they created an AI model that fundamentally changes the way to study a protein\'s structure. Given that even the Nobel Prize for physics went to computer scientists associated with AI, AI has been dominating the Nobel Prize this year, with someone even joking if AI was used in deciding the winners. It's notable that the AI model Hassabis and Jumper developed is central to understanding the structure of proteins, in which amino acids are linked together in long chains and then fold in a manner that plays a decisive role in its functioning. Since the 1970s, researchers have been trying to predict protein structures from their amino acid sequences so as to gain a deeper understanding of their functions, for which they even launched Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, which conducts community experiments in this regard. For long the accuracy rate of predictions was just about 40 percent, far below the required 90 percent. It was not until Hassabis and Jumper developed the AI model AlphaFold that the rate reached 60 percent, which has since got better with AlphaFold2. By understanding the three-dimensional structure of a protein, scientists can infer its role and how it interacts with other molecules, helping study diseases and develop new drugs. Besides, predicting protein structures helps in better comprehending the origins of life, which is linked to the Nobel Prize in physiology that went to researches in mRNA. All these date back to Hassabis and Jumper's AlphaFold model developed decades ago. Clearly, AI has helped mankind by making endless computations a cakewalk, in the process hastening studies of the protein structure. The scientists who developed it deserve the prize as more scientists will now be encouraged to study it.

153,Things to Know about All the Lies on Xinjiang: How Have They Come About?,"('Sami',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202104\30\WS608b4036a31024ad0babb623.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202104/30/WS608b4036a31024ad0babb623.html,"A colorful performance is presented for tourists in Korla City's Awat Township in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region on April 10. [Photo/Xinhua] Editor's Note: China Daily's think tank 'China Watch Institute' issued a report to brief readers about how some individuals and organizations in Western countries rolled out defamation campaign against the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in an attempt to discredit and suppress China. In recent years, manipulated and encouraged by the anti-China forces in the United States, some truth-bending ""academic institutions"", rumor-mongering ""experts and scholars"" and ""amateur actors"" with no moral scruples have created a chain of lies to defame Xinjiang and mislead international public discourse, often through dirty funding, fact-twisting stories and massive smear campaigns. Truth shall not be tainted, the world should not be deceived and narrative about Xinjiang mustn\'t be distorted. The recent reports by independent US news website thegrayzone.com and Australian publication Australian Alert Service, and a series of press conferences held by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have revealed the truth about the fraudulent Xinjiang-related ""databases"" and the so-called ""witness testimonies"" and, with abundant facts and figures, exposed the real mastermind behind them. Let us get to the bottom of what\'s going on and reveal the ins and outs of the lies about Xinjiang. I. As early as in the last century, the United States and other Western countries started to support separatist and terrorist activities in Xinjiang out of geopolitical purposes in order to destabilize China and contain its development.  During the Cold War, British scholar Bernard Lewis concocted the theory of ""arc of crisis"" aiming to fracture countries from the Middle East to India based on ethnic lines to divide the Soviet Union. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the National Security Adviser to President Carter, argued that the United States must prevent the realization of ""the age-long dream of Moscow to have direct access to the Indian Ocean"". The United States then launched Operation Cyclone, which lasted from 1979 to 1989 and cost up to US$630 million each year. Together with Saudi Arabia and Britain, the United States provided funding, equipment and training for Muslim guerrillas fighting against the Soviet Union.  Right after the Cold War ended, the United States and Britain started to use Xinjiang as a leverage to contain China, by supporting separatist and terrorist forces. The neoconservative forces in the US pivoted from the Soviet Union to containing China\'s influence in Central Asia. US and British intelligence agencies supported Pan-Turkism in order to weaken Russia and China and serve their agenda of maintaining a unipolar world. Over the years, there emerged a number of anti-China institutions and extremist groups seeking a state of ""East Turkistan"" or ""independence"" of Xinjiang, including the World Uyghur Congress and the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile. Since 2004, the National Endowment for Democracy has funneled US$8.76 million to Uyghur diaspora groups campaigning against China\'s policies in Xinjiang. The above-mentioned factors have caused the rapid spread of radical ideas in Xinjiang. Terrorists entered Xinjiang from the battlefields in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Some violent terrorist organizations overtly clamored for targeting and attacking Chinese nationals. Between 1997 and 2014, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) frequently plotted and carried out terrorist attacks, which claimed more than 1,000 civilian lives.  The CIA suggested in 2003 that should the US find itself in a crisis or confrontation with China in the future, the option of using the ""Uyghur card"" as a means of exerting pressure should not be taken off the table. Under this strategy, the United States, Britain and their allies, latching on to the Cold War mentality, have directed their intelligence establishments and anti-China scholars to mobilize Uyghur diaspora groups in spinning out misinformation about the so-called severe oppression of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, which was spread by mainstream Western media in a coordinated manner. Here are what they seek to achieve: First, a false impression that Muslims in Xinjiang support ""independence"". This is often done by instigating certain groups to carry out separatist activities to make the public believe people in Xinjiang all want an independent state. Second, the illusion that the ETIM is for peace. Nothing has been said about relevant groups' close ties with Al-Qaida and their violent and terrorist rhetoric. In November 2020, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo even removed the ETIM from the US list of foreign terrorist organizations. Third, the false claim of human rights violations in Xinjiang. Some organizations including Human Rights Watch have fabricated reports on Xinjiang, but their sources are just a small group of extremely anti-China overseas Uyghurs. The baseless accounts in those reports were further hyped up and spread by institutions such as the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).  In January 2017, then US Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard noted that under US law, it is illegal for anyone to provide funding or support for the Al-Qaida, ISIS or other terrorist organizations. However, the US government has long been, directly or indirectly, providing funds, weapons and intelligence support to these organizations through certain countries in the Middle East.  Lawrence Wilkerson, Chief of Staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell and retired US Army Colonel, when speaking at the Ron Paul Institute in August 2018 on the threefold purposes of the US presence in Afghanistan, stated unabashedly that ""the third reason we were there [in Afghanistan] is because there are 20 million Uyghurs [in Xinjiang]. The CIA would want to destabilize China and that would be the best way to do it to foment unrest and to join with those Uyghurs in pushing the Han Chinese in Beijing from internal places rather than external"".  In a video interview in 2015, Sibel Edmonds, a former interpreter with the FBI, talked about how the US had planned and acted to destabilize Xinjiang. She said that ""Xinjiang is the entry artery of energy. We want to, gradually and internally, play the gender card and the race card. For that part of the world, we want to play the minority without land. We say we are going to help them and they are being oppressed, Chinese are gunning them down and torturing them."" The plan of the US is to copy the tactics used in Afghanistan, Ukraine and Iraq to Xinjiang, making an issue out of thin air and exploit it. ""We hope Xinjiang to be the next Taiwan. As Western nations, we never cared about people. That is not within our interest area, unless it can be utilized, capitalized upon to get our objective."" https://citizensparty.org.au/specialreport-xinjiang-anglo-americanssponsor-east-turkistan-campaigns II. Adrian Zenz, by piecing together dubious information, irresponsibly claimed that millions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang are under detention. He is a far-right fundamentalist Christian, who bases his research on radical media reports and speculations.  Zenz is a so-called ""senior fellow for China studies"" with the far-right Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, an organization established by the US government in 1983 and is known for preaching regime change. The Foundation trumpets the ""double genocide"" theory that seeks to rewrite the history of the Holocaust and portrays communism as evil akin to Hitler\'s fascism. Zenz\'s politically-charged research on Xinjiang has been regarded by the Foundation as an important weapon.  The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation is an outgrowth of the National Captive Nations Committee founded by the Ukrainian nationalist Lev Dobriansky. Its co-chairman, Yaroslav Stetsko, was a senior leader of the Bandera faction of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN-B), a fascist militia. Both helped found the World Anti-Communist League, which was described by journalist Joe Conason as ""the organizational haven for neo-Nazis, fascists, and anti-Semitic extremists from two dozen countries"".  Zenz is a Christian evangelical eschatologist who believes that he is ""led by God"" on a ""mission"" against China. He is a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology, the German branch of the Columbia International University of the United States. This University considers the ""Bible [to be] the ultimate foundation and the final truth in every aspect of our lives"", and its mission is to ""educate people from a biblical worldview to impact the nations with the message of Christ"".  Zenz does not truly care about the Muslim community. A search of his Twitter profile returns no tweets concerning the rise of Islamophobia in the West, or US wars and drone strikes against Muslim-majority countries. His only Tweet concerning Muslims that is unrelated to China is a denial that there is a double standard in how violence is judged when committed by whites and by Muslims.  In September 2018, Zenz published an article in the Central Asian Survey journal, claiming that ""Xinjiang\'s total re-education internment figure may be estimated at just over one million."" This conclusion comes from a single report by Istiqlal TV, a Turkey-based Uyghur exile media organization. The report released an unverified table of ""re-education detainee figures"" allegedly ""leaked"" by the Chinese government, according to which a total of 892,000 individuals from 68 counties in Xinjiang had been detained as of spring 2018. The inflated figure was cited from a report by Radio Free Asia (RFA), a US-funded news agency formed by the CIA during the Cold War for anti-China propaganda. In addition, Istiqlal TV is no neutral media outlet. It advocates separatism and attracts various extremist figures. Abdulkadir Yapuquan, leader of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a UN Security Council listed terrorist organization, is a regular guest of it.  By cobbling together dubious sources, Zenz extrapolates an extremely broad estimate ""at anywhere between several hundred thousand and just over one million"". While admitting that ""there is no certainty"" to this estimate, he insisted that it is nevertheless ""reasonable to speculate"". He attempted to shirk responsibilities for the reliability of the numbers. As time moves on, Zenz continued to pump up his speculative estimate of Uyghur detainees. Speaking at an event organized by the US mission in Geneva in March 2019, he stated that ""although speculative, it seems appropriate to estimate that up to 1.5 million ethnic minorities [have been interned in Xinjiang]."" Zenz mentioned his estimate again in a November 2019 interview with RFA, claiming that China has detained 1.8 million people.  Western governments and media have accepted or even propagated the narratives of Zenz, instead of questioning his research based on irresponsible speculations. He became a US-recognized ""pundit"" on Xinjiang and wrote commentaries for mainstream US media outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and Democracy Now!. On 3 December 2019, the US House of Representatives adopted the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, calling on the Trump administration to impose sanctions on China over the alleged internment of over one million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China. Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on 10 December, Zenz took a victory lap of sorts to celebrate the passage of the Act at the Congress, and used the occasion to call for opening up a new front against China and starting a US investigation into ""involuntary labor in relation to Xinjiang."" https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/21/china-detaining-millions-uyghurs-problemsclaims-us-ngo-researcher/ III. The so-called research findings published by Zenz and others are full of blatant data faking and fraudulent claims. They confuse speculation with hard facts, blur the lines between propaganda and academic research, and fabricate anti-China narratives based on ideology.  Zenz\'s ""paper"" on ""forced sterilization"" in Xinjiang was quoted by former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who cited Zenz\'s name and ""paper"" to level his genocide allegation. This ""paper"" was also cited by the Associated Press, CNN and others, who apparently did no reality check at all on his research. The ""paper"" has never been published by any academic journals, or gone through any peer review. It was only released by the Jamestown Foundation founded under the direction of former CIA Director William J. Casey as an extra-governmental channel to pay Soviet dissidents and, in essence, as a front-line tool of the CIA.  Zenz\'s ""research"" based on no academic contexts, and his ""paper"" fraught with loopholes and data misuse, would fail to pass any academic publication review. His ""major finding"" was the claim that in 2018,""80 percent of all net added IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang."" It sounds like 80 percent of China\'s IUD insertions were carried out in Xinjiang. The original source of Zenz\'s claim, the 2019 China Health Statistics Yearbook, shows that the number of new IUD insertion procedures in Xinjiang in 2018 accounted for only 8.7 percent of China\'s total. (The total number of IUD insertion procedures in 2018 nationwide was about 3.77 million, among which about 330,000 were in Xinjiang.) Zenz then coined the phrase ""net added IUD insertions"", and found that the number of ""net added IUD insertions"" in China was around 300,000 (IUD added minus those removed), while the number in Xinjiang was around 239,000. He then concluded that the number of ""net added IUD insertions"" in Xinjiang accounted for about 80% of the national total. According to his logic, and take Henan Province for example, it registered a ""net added IUD insertions"" of 206,000, accounting for 69% of the national total. Adding the percentage of Xinjiang (80%) and that of Henan (69%) would be more than 100%, which makes no sense at all. Through this cunning trick, Zenz got the incendiary figure of 80%, but still he could not make out a good case. He manipulated data to produce a false impression that the majority of women in Xinjiang were forcibly or even compulsively sterilized.  A chart in Zenz\'s ""paper"" claims that new IUD placements in Xinjiang average between 800 and 1,400 per capita each year, which means each woman in the region would have to undergo 4 to 8 IUD insertion surgeries every day. The figures simply make no sense.  Zenz interpreted a photograph as part of an ""effort to enforce the thorough implementation of increasingly intrusive birth control efforts"". But those in the center of the photograph don\'t look like people of childbearing age. As a matter of fact, the photo is taken from an article by China News Service about a local poverty alleviation program in Xinjiang. The two elderly people in the photo were seeing the doctor for free, as part of the free health checkups and medical consultation offered to local residents under the program. The mix-up shows that Zenz either does not understand the Chinese language or knows little about the basic situation in Xinjiang.  In his ""paper"", Zenz tried to distort facts and framed any government spending on public health as part of the ""genocide"" policy, such as the US$5 billion funds provided by the Chinese central government between 2013 and 2017 to support healthcare and family planning programs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. When citing figures to make his argument, Zenz left out data on maternal and infant mortality reduction in Xinjiang. If China were really intending a ""genocide"" against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, there would have been no need to work so hard to reduce maternal and infant mortality.  When a ""scholar"" like Zenz was asked for opinion by public relations companies or think tanks in Washington, no one questioned his qualifications. It was only after an independent media investigation that it was found he didn\'t have the right academic credentials. Zenz blatantly misused data in order to draw biased conclusions about ""genocide"", which were then used by the US government and some of its hardliners to disrupt diplomacy between China and the US. For political elements who want Sino-US relations to deteriorate further, Zenz happened to be of great use.  The academic community in the US is facing tremendous pressure of censorship and self-censorship. Speaking the truth or questioning Zenz's claims in the media often comes with a price. Zenz once threatened to sue Joshua M. Landis, a well-known American expert on Syria, because Landis retweeted an article on the thegrayzone.com exposing Zenz. Landis' tweet was later deleted.  During the Bush administration, the US State Department used the media and Congress to manipulate public opinion and make up a story about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Now on Xinjiang, the same trick is being used to manipulate the media, Congress and even the public.  The US intervention campaign against Xinjiang actually started in the 1990s. The House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, backed by its then chair and Congressman Tom Lantos, a supporter of subverting foreign governments, received some ""Uyghurs in exile"" who made similar testimonies about forced abortion and so on. The organizers of this campaign tried to stop Bill Clinton and his administration from granting China most favored nation (MFN) status, but they failed. https://thegrayzone.com/2021/02/18/us-media-reports-chinese-genocide-relied-onfraudulent-far-right-researcher/ IV. A ""report"" released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in March 2020 claims that ""more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019"". In fact, this ""report"" is full of loopholes and lacks the minimum factual basis.  The ASPI is not an independent, impartial research institute. It receives funding from the Australian Department of Defence, NATO, the US State Department, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and arms producers such as Lockheed Martin from the US.  The lead author of the ""report"" is Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, an anti-China individual who has defended the Falun Gong cult and described Chinese-Australians who oppose the violent rioters in Hong Kong as being ""brainwashed"" by the Chinese government.  The ""report"" is self-contradictory and does not add up. For example, on the one hand, it decries the ""isolation"" of the minority workers who ""speak almost no Mandarin"" and whose ""communication with locals is largely non-existent."" On the other hand, it denounces Mandarin language classes offered to workers as insidious ""political indoctrination"".  The ""report"" presents no original evidence on ""forced laborers"", but cites anonymous ""testimonies"" from an obscure, far-right online blog called ""Bitter Winter"". The blog is a project of the Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR), an Italy-based organization that supported various cult organizations such as Falun Gong, Aum Shinrikyo, and the Church of Almighty God (Eastern Lightning).  The Australian media has suppressed the criticism of the ""report"" and attempted to manipulate public opinion. Shortly after the release of the ""report"", the Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired a program on the lead author, Vicky Xiuzhong Xu. According to a Chinese-Australian interviewed by the program, the interviewer pushed him to praise Vicky\'s research on Xinjiang and made it clear that they were not looking for negative comments. A Chinese Muslim living in Australia revealed that Australian media outlets often attempt to manipulate Chinese-Australians into echoing the official narrative on China, and said that an interviewer from SBS, a television network funded by the Australian government, ""wanted me to confirm her narrative that the Chinese government had operatives following me and were actively suppressing me in Australia"". https://thegrayzone.com/2020/03/26/forced-laborchina-us-nato-arms-industry-coldwar/ V. When the slanderous claims against China were ready for use, instead of verifying their veracity, some Western media outlets rushed to hype them up. To create fake news, the BBC even went so far as to pay for ""evidence"".  Barrie V Veiss, a former British media professional, revealed in detail on social media the entire process of Western media concocting fake news about Xinjiang. He pinpointed an important source of the fake news to be the anti-China activist Adrian Zenz. Zenz, who had initially rejected the BBC invitation to look for ""evidence"" against China, changed his mind after receiving a commission from the BBC.  In July 2019, Zenz tweeted: The BBC commissioned my research. They asked the first time whether it could be done. I said ""no"", too hard, too little evidence. They asked again. I said: ""let me see what I can find"". Well, the resulting findings now total 17,000 words and 163 footnotes.  After Zenz published his so-called ""The Karakax List: Dissecting the Anatomy of Beijing\'s Internment Drive in Xinjiang"", Western media outlets such as CNN, BBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Deutsche Welle rushed to cite the so-called ""conclusions"", without any investigation or verification, to badmouth and spread lies about Xinjiang\'s counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures. Some even tagged their coverage as ""exclusive"" to steal public attention. However, when China released documentaries on fighting terrorism in Xinjiang, these same media outlets all went into silent mode and turned a blind eye.  On 10 February 2021, at the fourth Press Conference on Xinjiang-related Issues co-hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Xu Guixiang, Deputy Director General of the Publicity Department of the CPC Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, commented on BBC\'s habitual practice of fabricating stories and creating troubles on Xinjiang-related issues. ""I had taken an interview by BBC in Xinjiang myself,"" said Xu. ""We showed our greatest sincerity by making the best possible arrangements for their visit. We were open and candid in our conversation, and met all their interview requests. The coverage they produced later, however, completely distorted the facts,"" Xu added. ""Not long ago, the journalists from BBC took videos of the local residents in Aksu Prefecture without their consent. And without interviewing even one Uyghur, they claimed to have obtained solid evidence of \'massive forced labor\' in Xinjiang. What they had was nothing but a few non-live-action satellite images and the so-called reports churned out by anti-China elements. They even publicly pressed foreign companies that have invested and built factories in Xinjiang to pull out their investment.""""Such moves trampled the ethics of journalism, deviated from the principles of objectivity, impartiality and fairness, and ran counter to facts. They have fully exposed BBC\'s vicious intention of spreading lies and rumors against Xinjiang to serve political purpose, and ruined its reputation as a well-known international media outlet.""  On 6 August 2020, ""China Uighurs: A model\'s video gives a rare glimpse inside internment"", a news report edited by BBC Beijing correspondent John Sudworth based on a video clip shot by a drug dealer and several text messages, alluded that the Chinese government held large numbers of Uyghurs in detention camps and put them under torture and abuse. Merdan Ghappar, the man appearing in the video, is a criminal arrested and convicted in accordance with the law for drug trafficking. According to Chinese laws and regulations, it is a normal procedure for him to return to his place of origin and report to local authorities after being released from prison. However, Sudworth purposefully misinterpreted it as the government\'s attempt to send Ghappar into the internment camp. As in other Sudworth-made stories, the report is filled with disinformation such as separation of families in Xinjiang, forced sterilization of Uyghur women, and millions of Uyghurs and ethnic minorities held in internment camps. Citing unverified document urging for repentance and surrender, text messages from Ghappar and radical views of the criminal\'s exiling uncle Abdulhakim Ghappar, pseudo-scholar Adrian Zenz and anti-China elements such as James A. Millward, this ideologically biased report made groundless accusations against China\'s ethnic and religious policies.  On 12 January 2021, The New York Times published Amelia Pang\'s article ""It Took a Genocide for Me to Remember My Uighur Roots"" in its Opinion section. Using her 1/8 Uyghur origin, Pang portrayed herself and her family as victims of the so-called ""genocide"" by the Chinese government. The truth is, Pang has never been to China, yet she claimed that ""China\'s pressured assimilation insurance policies nonetheless reached me"". During her five years of service at The Epoch Times, the mouthpiece of the Falun Gong cult, Pang published at least 17 articles to promote the cult organization and fabricated a large number of exaggerated and unfounded anti-China reports. In October 2020, The New York Times published an article on the true face of The Epoch Times, calling it ""a force in right-wing media"", ""pushing dangerous conspiracy theories"" and ""feed[ing] the online fever swamps of the far right"". Yet only a few months later, the newspaper took a totally different position, which puts its professionalism, authenticity and motives in serious question.  At the webinar ""Genocide in Xinjiang?A Discovery Zoom Panel"", Daniel Dumbrill, a famous Canadian YouTuber, pointed to the inconsistent statements given by a ""genocide survivor"" widely-reported on CNN and BBC in different interviews. It was also found that the Chinese government renewed her passport when she claimed to be under arrest. The date of renewal is the only pixelated information on her passport that appeared in the CNN footage. VI. The Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) is the first organization to propagate that China has detained millions of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang. With the support of the US government, the organization used crude and clumsy research methods and the conclusions produced are seriously flawed.  The CHRD is a Washington-based NGO backed by the US government. It is directly funded by the US government and receives a large amount of financial support from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an organization controlled by the US government to promote regime change. Over the years, the CHRD has been working on behalf of far-right opposition figures who have glorified colonialism and appealed for the ""Westernization"" of China.  In 2018, the CHRD submitted a report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discriminationwhich was often falsely cited by Western media outlets as a UN-authored report. The CHRD claimed that the figures in the report were ""based on interviews and limited data"". But in fact, they interviewed only eight Uyghurs. (The Uyghur population in Xinjiang was 12,718,400 in 2018.) Based on these few samples, the CHRD extrapolated estimates that ""at least 10% of villagers [] are being detained in re-education detention camps, and 20% are being forced to attend day/evening re-education sessions in the villages or townships, totaling 30% in both types of camps"". Then, by applying the estimated ratio to the total population of Xinjiang, the CHRD absurdly concluded that one million ethnic Uyghurs have been detained in ""re-education detention camps"" and two million more have been ""forced to attend day/evening re-education sessions"".  Taking the groundless CHRD report as reliable data, the US government accused China of ""arbitrary detention"" of ""at least 800,000, and possibly more than 2 million, Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities in internment camps"". Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2018, State Department official Scott Busby stated that this ""is the US government assessment, backed by our intelligence community and open source reporting."" https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/21/china-detaining-millions-uyghursproblems-claims-us-ngo-researcher/ VII. The ""First Independent Report"" on Xinjiang which was widely reported in Western media actually came from an institution funded by a sham university.  In March 2021, the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a self-styled think tank, published the so-called ""first independent report"" on Xinjiang. The report claims that China has breached ""each and every act"" of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in its treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The report and the Institute received extensive coverage by mainstream media outlets such as CNN, The Guardian and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Founded in 2019 and based in Washington D.C., the Newlines Institute purportedly aims to ""enhance US foreign policy based on a deep understanding of the geopolitics of the different regions of the world and their value systems"". Its founder and president once served as a member of the advisory board for the US military\'s Africa Command. Anti-China scholar Adrian Zenz is also on its team.  Tom Fowdy, an Oxford graduate and East Asia specialist, revealed in Chollima Report, a website he runs, that the Newlines Institute is actually a front for the Institute of Islamic Thought, an Islamist neo-conservative organization in the US linked to Egypt's Muslim brotherhood, whose members have pleaded guilty to sponsoring terrorism.  In April 2021, Thore Vestby, former mayor of Norway\'s Frogn municipality, worked with Dutch and Danish scholars and published a special paper titled ""The Xinjiang Genocide Determination As Agenda"" through the Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research. The special paper points out that the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy is highly consistent with the official position of the United States. The institute\'s members who drafted the Xinjiang-related report are anticommunists and anti-China elements who have long been influenced by Christian fundamentalism and extreme conservatism, and the institute\'s independence is suspicious. The timing of formulating and releasing of the report highly coincides with the time when the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of ""genocide"" in Xinjiang. The report blindly backs up Pompeo, but does not give any valuable evidence; there is an obvious bias in the selection of original materials, and it quotes a large number of falsified data and misinterpreted information; a large number of valuable, real information is deliberately ignored by the writers. The report clearly supports the US adopting a hardline foreign policy toward China as well as the use of human rights issues to contain and suppress China, which is seriously inconsistent with the position of the ""Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy"" as a neutral academic institution to seek mutual understanding and peace. The mainstream media in the West have collectively ignored the serious loopholes in the report and rushed to cite it without verification, reflecting that the military industry-media-think tank interest consortium in the United States enjoys a great power, and that the relevant institutions have been completely reduced to accomplices of interest groups.  The Newlines Institute is funded by Fairfax University of America (FXUA), an unaccredited sham university formerly known as Virginia International University. In 2019, state regulators of Virginia found the academic quality and rigor of FXUA\'s online education ""patently deficient"" and the university\'s certificate to operate was almost revoked. Data from the US Department of Education show that between 2020 and 2021, the university has 153 registered students, and its official Twitter account has only 13 followers.  The advisory board of the FXUA is composed of heads of military contractors. The Consolidated Analysis Centers Incorporated (CACI), which was involved in the Abu Ghraib prison incident in Iraq, is one of them.  According to a report carried by Xinhuanet in 2007, lawyers from the US Center for Constitutional Rights note that a group of more than 250 former Iraqi prisoners filed a lawsuit against CACI for torture during interrogation in Iraq. https://thegrayzone.com/2021/03/17/report-uyghur-genocide-sham-university-neocon-punish-china/ https://transnational.live/2021/04/27/%f0%9f%9f%a5-breaking-thexinjiang-genocide-determinationas-agenda/ VIII. The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international separatist network. One of WUC\'s affiliate organizations, the right-wing Uyghur American Association (UAA), advocates a hardline China policy, and believes in violent activities to achieve its goals. The US government has supported and subsidized Uyghur extremist organizations through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). In the name of promoting and protecting Uyghur human rights, these organizations attempt to stoke Western hostility against China, with the aim of subverting China and establishing an ""East Turkistan"" nation-state in Xinjiang.  The WUC is a far-right, anticommunist, ultra-nationalist organization made up of Uyghur separatists in exile; its mission is to subvert China and establish an ""East Turkistan"" nation-state. Headquartered in Munich, the WUC is an international umbrella organization with 33 affiliates in 18 countries and regions, including the Uyghur American Association, the Uyghur Human Rights Project, and Campaign for Uyghurs.  Under its cover as a ""human rights organization"", the WUC is in fact a separatist network funded and directed by the US, and a key organization in Washington\'s attempt at a new Cold War against China. In collusion with the NED and Radio Free Asia (RFA), an anti-China media outlet, the WUC is tightly aligned with Washington\'s foreign policy agenda which seeks to contain and impede the rise of China. Many leading members of the WUC have served in senior positions in anti-China media outlets, including the RFA and Radio Liberty. For example, Omer Kanat, Chairman of the WUC Executive Committee, was RFA's senior editor from 1999 to 2009.  The WUC relies heavily on US funding. Since its inception, the WUC has received support from the NED. Since 2016, the NED has provided the WUC with as much as US$1.284 million, and millions of dollars of additional funding to WUC affiliates. In 2018, NED funding to the WUC and its affiliates reached nearly US$665,000, and in 2019, US$960,000, up by almost 50%. In 2020, the NED boasted that it had given Uyghur groups US$8.758 million since 2004, and claimed to be ""the only institutional funder for Uyghur advocacy and human rights organizations"".  In addition to funding from the NED, the WUC and its affiliates have other means to collect money. For instance, on the WUC website, there is a donation portal allowing two types of donation: one-time donation and monthly recurring donation. One only needs to enter bank card information and the money will go immediately to the WUC.  In recent years, the WUC and its affiliates have used these funds to churn out fabricated stories such as ""alleged concentration camps that detain millions of people"" and ""The Karakax List"" in collaboration with Western media outlets hostile to China. They have worked with pseudo-scholars such as Adrian Zenz to clamor for a new Cold War against China and to label China\'s Xinjiang policy as ""genocide"". And they have called on countries to impose sanctions and boycott China.  Although claiming to be ""peaceful and nonviolent"", the WUC and its affiliates have established connections with the far-right Turkish group Grey Wolves, which has engaged in violent activities from Syria to East Asia. In July 2015, the ETIM instigated large-scale anti-China demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul. Hundreds of demonstrators chanting religious slogans attacked in front of the Topkapi Palace a group of Asian tourists, who turned out to be South Koreans. Devlet Baheli, leader of the Turkish MHP, a party closely connected to the Grey Wolves, defended the attacks with extremely racist comments: ""How are you going to differentiate between Korean and Chinese? They both have slanted eyes."" In August of the same year, the Grey Wolves and ""East Turkistan"" forces carried out a bomb attack at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, Thailand, killing 20 people. The attack was allegedly in retaliation for ""the Thai government\'s decision to repatriate a group of Uyghurs to China"". These ""East Turkistan"" elements were trying to travel illegally through Thailand to Turkey and Syria to join the ETIM or other extremist groups in those regions.  While establishing ties with far-right organizations in Turkey, the main representatives of the WUC called on Turkey to take ""interventionist actions"" against China, similar to what it did in Libya and Syria. Wearing Turkish military uniforms, Uyghur militants released a video on the Turkish side of the Turkish-Syrian border in which they threatened to ""wage war against China"". Some militants held up guns and threatened in the Chinese language to ""kill all the Chinese people"", and then chanted jihadist slogans.  The UAA was founded in 1998 and has received millions of dollars in funding from the NED. In recent years, the UAA has worked closely with Washington and other Western governments to promote hostility toward China. ""The National Endowment for Democracy has been exceptionally supportive of the UAA,"" stated Nury Turkel, former UAA President, in 2006, ""providing us with essential funding"". The goal of the UAA is to exploit Washington\'s support to promote regime change in China. Many important allies of the UAA are anti-Muslim, far-right elements in Washington, including Republican Congressman Ted Yoho, the Family Research Council, as well as the FBI.  While the UAA claims to represent the interests of China's Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, many of its closest allies are in fact anti-Muslim, far-right forces and figures, such as ultra-conservative Republican Congressman Ted Yoho, the Family Research Council that practices Christian fundamentalism, and the FBI that is notorious for spying on American Muslims, deliberately concocting terrorist plots, and entrapping Muslim-American youths. Kuzzat Altay, the current president of the UAA, often makes pro-American and anti-China statements on social media, supporting the launch of a new Cold War against China, applauding the Trump administration's trade and technology war with China, and saying that all countries should treat China as a criminal. During the pandemic, the UAA and members of its affiliate organizations spread far-right rhetoric, incited hatred against Asians, called COVID-19 the ""China virus"", and slandered China as waging a ""virus war"" on the world and ""purposefully, intentionally exporting the virus to cause the pandemic."" On 21 March 2021, organized by the UAA, some US-government-funded Uyghur extremists disrupted a gathering against anti-Asian racism in Washington D.C. They barked anti-China slogans such as ""Wipe out China!"" and drove vehicles adorned with signs bearing slogans such as ""Boycott China"" and ""CCP killed 80 million Chinese people."" Their heckling of anti-racist demonstrators was heavily criticized and widely condemned on social media in the United States. The UAA then tried its best to distance itself from extremism and racism, but refused to retract its slogans such as ""Wipe out China!""  Many key members of the UAA set up a military training organization called ""Altay Defense"" and arranged for US military instructors to conduct weapons training for members of Uyghur separatist movement. The UAA claims that all the training was provided by former US special forces officers, such as James Lang, a US Defense Department weapons trainer and former US Army Ranger who served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Faruk Altay, the head of Altay Defense, is brother of UAA president Kuzzat Altay and nephew of former WUC president Rebiya Kadeer. He is also a right-wing, anti-communist, ultra-nationalist, as shown by his remarks on social media. Participants in Altay Defense training sessions also included UAA's incumbent president Kuzzat Altay and Bahram Sintash, a member of the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), who was a key player in lobbying the US Congress to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019.  The UAA's leadership consists of employees of the US government, Radio Free Asia, and the military-industrial complex. Nury Turkel, former president (2004-2006), co-founded the UHRP with the NED. In 2020, Turkel was appointed a commissioner on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom by Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Rebiya Kadeer, former president (2006-2011), is a longtime figurehead of overseas ""East Turkistan"" forces. Kadeer\'s husband, Sidik Rouzi, worked for US government media outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Under Kadeer\'s leadership, the WUC and the UAA forged close ties with the Bush administration. Ilshat Hassan Kokbore, former president (2016-2019), has worked with Booz Allen Hamilton, a notorious private US military and intelligence contractor, since 2008. Edward Snowden was employed at the firm when he decided to blow the whistle on its invasive, all-encompassing system of mass surveillance. Omer Kanat, former vice president, serves as WUC's Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has a lengthy history of working with the US government, from serving as senior editor of Radio Free Asia's Uyghur Service from 1999 to 2009, to covering the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and interviewing the Dalai Lama for the network. Rushan Abbas, former vice president, is the US National Security Agency\'s favorite human rights activist and became the first Uyghur journalist and Uyghur news anchor when the US Congress funded the establishment of the Uyghur department of Radio Free Asia in 1998. She went to the United States in 1989 to study genetic engineering. After graduation, she married a Turkish-American and stayed in the United States, and was later employed by the CIA. She often boasted in her biography of her ""extensive experience working with US government agencies, including Homeland Security, Department of Defense, State Department, and various US intelligence agencies"". She served as a ""consultant at Guantanamo Bay supporting Operation Enduring Freedom"" during the Bush administration\'s so-called war on terror. Following a disastrous publicity appearance on Reddit\'s ""Ask Me Anything"" Q&A forum, during which participants blasted Abbas as a ""CIA Asset"" and US government collaborator, she has attempted to scrub her biographic information from the internet. Abbas currently heads the Campaign for Uyghurs, a WUC affiliate organization. The current leadership of the UAA includes: President Kuzzat Altay. Nephew of Rebiya Kadeer, Kuzzat Altay is fervently anti-communist and pro-US. He is known to have glorified the ""East Turkistan"" separatist movement, comparing it to the founding of the State of Israel. Secretary Elfidar Iltebir. Her sister, Elnigar Iltebir, was appointed under the Trump administration as Director for China in the White House National Security Council. Their father, Ablikim Baqi Iltebir, worked for US government-funded media outlet Radio Free Asia from February 2000 to August 2017. Treasurer Arslan Khakiyev. Khakiyev worked for Radio Free Asia for 18 years. His wife, Gulchehra Hoja, has been with Radio Free Asia since 2001.  In 2004, the NED helped the UAA to found the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), and became its primary funder. Between 2016 and 2019 alone, the NED granted the UHRP US$1.2447 million. UHRP-affiliated projects such as Advocacy and Outreach for Uyghur Human Rights and Advocating for Uyghur Human Rights through Artistic Interaction have also received considerable funding. The UHRP has brought in main leaders of the WUC such as Nury Turkel and Omer Kanat. Many holding senior management positions in the NED have joined the UHRP, such as former NED Vice President Louisa Greve, now serving as Director of Global Advocacy for the UHRP. https://thegrayzone.com/2020/03/05/world-uyghur-congress-us-far-right-regimechange-network-fall-china/ https://thegrayzone.com/2021/03/31/china-uyghurgun-soldiers-empire/ IX. The so-called ""Xinjiang Victims Database"" poorly put together by anti-China forces is an ill-motivated and baseless project designed purely for political manipulation. In recent years, anti-China forces have concocted the ""Xinjiang Data Project"", ""Xinjiang Victims Database"" and ""Uyghur Transitional Judicial Database"" by gathering made-up ""witness accounts"" to misrepresent Xinjiang to the world. Research and verification shows that, of the 12,050 names listed in the three ""databases"", 1,342 are simply non-existent. Among the 10,708 real names, 6,962 are people living a normal life; 3,244 are convicted for crimes of endangering public security, violent terrorism or other criminal offences; 238 are dead of causes such as illness, and 264 are living outside China. Here is the truth about some of the much reported cases in the so-called ""databases"".  The first category of those cases involve people who fabricated personal experiences. Some of the ""witnesses"" in the ""databases"" are, in fact, hired by Western anti-China forces. These ""witnesses"" act out the made-up stories to smear Xinjiang abroad and make a living out of it. They choose to be the pawns of Western anti-China forces in exchange for refugee status and material benefits, making up one lie after another about their so-called experience in the vocational education and training centers only to be busted by the truth time and again. 1. Sayragul Sauytbay Sayragul Sauytbay, female, born in 1976, is from Zhaosu County of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China Sayragul Sauytbay claimed to have been an instructor at a ""rehabilitation class"" and accessed classified documents before leaving China, and to be able to prove that 2,500 people were interned where she worked. On 12 December 2019, Sayragul Sauytbay claimed in a video clip released by the BBC that during her days at the ""detention camp"", she had been beaten on the head by an electric baton and her personal freedom was restricted, and that surveillance cameras were installed in all the classrooms, dormitories and bathrooms in the ""camp"". On 4 March 2020, Sayragul Sauytbay received the US State Department\'s annual International Women of Courage Award. Mike Pompeo said at the awards ceremony, ""Today we also honor Sayragul Sauytbay. Formerly a medical doctor, she was separated from her family, tortured, imprisoned, and faced execution because of her courage to simply speak the truth."" On 20 April 2020, Japanese manga artist Tomomi Shimizu drew cartoons telling a story of ""persecution"" from the perspective of Sayragul Sauytbay, picturing her as the ""survivor of re-education camp"". (2) Reality check In April 2016, Sayragul Sauytbay was appointed head of the Central Kindergarten of Chahanwusu Town, Zhaosu County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. On 19 March 2018, she became an elementary school teacher in Chahanwusu. Half a month later, on 4 April, she asked for leave from the school. The next day, she left China illegally. To set the record straight, first of all, Sayragul Sauytbay lied about her experience. She claimed to be a medical-university graduate who had worked as a doctor, but the truth is she only attended nursing course at a vocational school in Ili and has never been a doctor. She initially said she was an instructor at an education and training center, but later claimed to be a victim interned and tortured, subjected to medical experiment and forced to eat pork in the ""concentration camp"". As a matter of fact, she has never worked or studied at any education and training center, still less been subjected to any compulsory measure. Her whole account of the center is nothing but smear and slander. Second, Sayragul Sauytbay is a criminal suspect. On 5 April 2018, she left China illegally carrying a Chinese border pass. Her conduct violated the provisions of Article 322 of the Criminal Law of China on illegal border crossing. In June 2015 and December 2016, she obtained two loans totaling 470,000 yuan from the rural credit cooperative of Chahanwusu Town with forged real estate purchase contract and guarantor's signature and fake documents. To this day, she has yet to repay 398,000 yuan worth of debt. Her conduct violated the provisions of Article 193 of the Criminal Law of China on loan fraud. Due to her criminal offences, she has been listed online as a wanted person by the public security authorities according to legal procedures. Third, Sayragul Sauytbay has a record of dishonest behavior. When she was head of the Central Kindergarten of Chahanwusu Town, she took advantage of her position and appropriated performance bonuses, which hurt the interests of her fellow colleagues. As a result, she was removed from office by the local education authorities in accordance with laws and regulations. Before illegally crossing the border, she talked her younger sister Panar into obtaining a loan worth 45,000 yuan and buying her car, but she never transferred ownership of the vehicle to Panar, much to Panar's resentment. 2. Mihrigul Tursun Mihrigul Tursun, female, born in 1985, is from Qiemo County of Xinjiang. In August 2010, she registered for marriage with an Iranian in China, and in January 2012, with an Egyptian in Egypt. In April 2015, she gave birth to triplets in Egypt. Two of her children were registered for permanent residence in China in October 2015, and another was entrusted to the care of her husband's cousin. On 22 April 2018, Mihrigul Tursun left China with her husband and two children. (1) Activities outside China Mihrigul Tursun went to the United States in April 2018. There, she attended a hearing of the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China as a witness, and gave false testimony citing her so-called ""personal experience"". In her interviews with CNN and other media outlets, she claimed that she was detained by the police in a ""concentration camp"", and was forced to take or get injected with unknown medicines. She claimed that people detained there were suffering from torture everyday, and she herself witnessed the death of nine women. She said that one of her sons died in the Urumqi Children\'s Hospital, and nobody told her why he was admitted for treatment. (2) Reality check First, Mihrigul Tursun was fully free in China except for the 20 days under criminal detention. On 21 April 2017, she was criminally detained by the Public Security Bureau of Qiemo County on suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination. She was confirmed to have infectious diseases. The Bureau revoked the compulsory measures on 10 May 2017 out of humanitarian considerations. Between 2010 and 2017, she made 11 trips between China and countries including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Turkey. Second, Mihrigul Tursun had never studied in any vocational education and training center, nor had she ever been forced to take any medicine. She claimed that the drugs and medicine she was injected with in the ""concentration camp"" caused her infertility. As verified by investigation, there was no sterilization record, and her parents said that she was fertile. She also lied about her younger brother, claiming that he was abused to death in a vocational education and training center. When hearing this, Akbar Tursun, her ""dead"" brother, stated publicly that Mihrigul was a habitual liar, and that she had not only lied about his death, but also rumored about watching others die. Third, Mihrigul Tursun's son did not die when receiving treatment in Urumqi. One of her sons, due to illnesses such as pneumonia, hydrocephalus and right-side indirect inguinal hernia, was taken to Urumqi Children's Hospital by Mihrigul Tursun herself and her family. The boy was hospitalized for treatment from 14 to 19 January, from 6 to 12 May and from 4 to 8 November in 2016. In April 2018, Mihrigul Tursun and her husband left China with this child. 3. Zumrat Dawut Zumrat Dawut, female, born in 1982, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang. She left China in January 2019. (1) Activities outside China Since 20 September 2019, in interviews with Radio Free Asia and other media outlets, Zumrat Dawut claimed to have been interrogated by the public security departments in Xinjiang and detained in a vocational education and training center for reasons including being married to a Pakistani. She alleged that she had been brutally persecuted, forced to take contraceptives with other women detained there, and forced to undergo sterilization with her uterus resected. She also asserted that she was served a pork dish in the Han family that her family was paired up with. On 24 September and 2 October 2019, she attended as a witness and gave false testimony at a panel discussion on ""international religious freedom"" and a seminar on ""human rights crises in Xinjiang"" held by the US State Department. On 12 October, she said that her neighbor in Xinjiang told her that her father had died after multiple rounds of police interrogations. (2) Reality check First, Zumrat Dawut had never studied in any vocational education and training center. This was confirmed by her fifth eldest brother Abduheili Dawut in an interview. Second, Zumrat Dawut had never undergone any forced sterilization. Before she gave birth to her third child in the Urumqi Maternal and Child Health Hospital in March 2013, she had signed a delivery consent form, agreeing to a cesarean section and tubal ligation, and she received the surgeries at the hospital. She never had a forced sterilization, not to mention any hysterectomy. Third, the so-called ""pork dish"" was a sheer fabrication. The paired-up family she referred to is the family of Zhao Qilin, the paired-up family of her fifth eldest brother Abduheili Dawut. In January 2018, Zhao Qilin invited Abduheili Dawut, his wife Horqiz Ahmat and his sister Zumrat Dawut over to his home. Zhao\'s mother cooked for the guests. There is no chance that Zhao\'s mother, an ethnic Hui herself, would ever prepare a pork dish. The two families took a picture when having dinner together. Fourth, Zumrat Dawut's father had never been detained. According to her fifth eldest brother Abduheili Dawut, their father had been living with his children all along, and had never been investigated or detained. Their father passed away due to coronary heart disease. Zumrat Dawut's claim that her father died after police interrogations was a complete lie. 4. Gulzira Auelhan Gulzira Auelhan, female, born in 1979, is from Yining County of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China In an interview with the BBC on 15 January 2020, Gulzira Auelhan claimed that she had been detained for 15 months, during which she was tortured and injected with unknown medicine. She purported that she had worked in a glove factory after being released and had to report to the police on her whereabouts, and that her husband was also under surveillance after he was released. (2) Reality check First, Gulzira Auelhan defaulted on a bank loan. It was found out that she, along with four others in her village as co-guarantors, borrowed 40,000 yuan from the Yining County Rural Credit Cooperative. She never paid back the interest of the loan even after it had matured, and was blacklisted by the bank. Second, she has a record of dishonest behavior. In her interview with The Globe and Mail, she said that her life goal was to bring up her children. Yet facts proved otherwise. She has no biological child, and has been indifferent to her three stepdaughters of her third husband. After she left China, she even asked her stepdaughters to pay her debts. 5. Tursunay Ziyawudun Tursunay Ziyawudun, female, born in 1978, is from Xinyuan County of Ili Prefecture of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China After leaving China on 26 September 2019, Tursunay Ziyawudun had several interviews by the BBC and other foreign media outlets, during which she claimed that women detained at the education and training centers had to either undergo surgical sterilization or take medicine to stop menstruation, and that she was forced to undergo irreversible tubal ligation and sterilization. In an interview with the BBC on 2 February 2021, she said she had ""experienced and seen sexual abuse"". (2) Reality check First, Tursunay Ziyawudun has never had any medical record of contraceptive operation. Second, what she said in the interviews is inconsistent. In an interview with the BBC this year, she said that police at the center knocked her on the floor and kicked her in the abdomen, and she almost passed out. However, in an interview with the American website Buzzfeed last year, she said ""I wasn\'t beaten or abused."" She claimed that she was under house arrest from January to June 2019. But her passport was issued on 13 March 2019, and passports must be applied in person at government agencies. If she were under house arrest, how could she go out to apply for her passport? 6. Rahman Shanbay Rahman Shanbay, female, born in 1987, is from Tekes County of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China After leaving China on 19 December 2018, she was interviewed by The Globe and Mail and other foreign media outlets. She claimed that she was interned in a room with 24 women, and was chained with handcuffs and shackles for one week because the application ""WhatsApp"" was installed on her cell phone. (2) Reality check First, Rahman Shanbay underwent investigation in accordance with the law. She was inquired by local police after being reported to have stored terrorist and extremist audios and videos on her cell phone and watched them frequently. Given the minor nature of her crime, her confession and remorse, she received only admonition as required by law. Second, Rahman Shanbay was never interned. Her mother Danishban Musa said ""my daughter indeed went to a police station and was subjected to inquiry because she was influenced by religious extremism and was suspected of committing a crime. However, she came back only three hours later, and since then she has stayed at home, helping me and my husband take care of the cattle.""  The second category of those cases involve people who fabricated stories about their relatives. Some anti-China individuals staying abroad fabricated lies about their relatives being arrested, persecuted or missing, in an attempt to garner sympathy from the international community and serve their schemes. Such unfounded claims are seriously misleading to the international community. Even their relatives in China have spoken out to debunk their lies. 1. Ferkat Jawdat Ferkat Jawdat, male, born in 1992, is from Yining City of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China After going to the United States on 23 January 2011, Ferkat Jawdat organized ""collective testimony"" in several other countries, pieced together information of trainees at the so-called ""concentration camps"" and led the allegation campaign ""Me Too Uyghur"". He claimed that his mother was detained in a ""concentration camp"" for 12 months and imprisoned for three months. In March 2019, he was ""received"" by Mike Pompeo as one of the so-called ""survivors of internment camps"" and their family members. (2) Reality check Ferkat Jawdat and his father, brother and two sisters live in the United States. His mother Minawar Tursun leads a normal life in China. As Minawar Tursun said, she has video calls with her son almost every day. 2. Kuzzat Altay Kuzzat Altay, whose real name is Kuzzat Mamat, is nephew of Rebiya Kadeer, former head of the World Uyghur Congress. Born in 1984, he is from Urumqi of Xinjiang and now lives in the United States. On 26 October 2019, Kuzzat Mamat became president of the Uyghur American Association. (1) Activities outside China At a press conference at the US Congress held by the Coalition to Advance Religious Freedom in China, an anti-China organization, as well as in interviews since February 2019, he claimed that his father Mamat Qadir was arrested and probably had died. (2) Reality check It has been verified that Kuzzat Altay's father Mamat Qadir lives a normal life in Urumqi. 3. Guljahra Qeyum Guljahra Qeyum, female, born in 1973, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang. She is a journalist and news presenter of the Uyghur language department of Radio Free Asia and a member of the Uyghur American Association. On 8 May 2017, she was listed online as a wanted person by the public security authorities on suspicion of joining a terrorist organization. (1) Activities outside China In July 2018, Guljahra Qeyum attended a meeting of the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China and said that her parents were detained in an internment camp. In March 2019, she was ""received"" by Mike Pompeo as one of the so-called ""survivors of internment camps"" and their family members. (2) Reality check Guljahra Qeyum's parents lead a normal life. Her 79-year-old father Abduqeyum Ghoja suffers from paralysis caused by cerebral infarction. Her mother Chimangul Zikir, aged 73, has several medical conditions including cardiac disease, hypertension and varicose veins in calves, and she needs to take care of her husband at home. They expressed no interest in traveling abroad due to poor health. 4. Yiminjan Sadul Yiminjan Sadul, male, born in 1965, is former associate professor of the History Department of the Xinjiang Islamic Institute. (1) False story by foreign media Yiminjan Sadul\'s daughter Samre Yiminjan claimed that her father was arrested by the authorities in Xinjiang for publishing an Arabic grammar book in 2014, and that she learned in November 2019 that he was sentenced to 15 years\' imprisonment for the ""crime of inciting and advocating extremist ideology"". On 13 February 2020, a Washington Post journalist published an article entitled ""Boston Uighur Woman Champions Her Father\'s Release"", claiming that Samre Yiminjan\'s father Yiminjan Sadul was detained by Chinese officials and arrested over charges of extremism. (2) Reality check It has been verified that Yiminjan Sadul lives a free life. 5. Arpat Arkin Arpat Arkin, male, born in 1997, is from Yining City of Xinjiang. On 29 October 2015, he travelled abroad and joined the World Uyghur Congress. (1) Activities outside China In February 2019, Arpat Arkin tweeted that his mother had been put in a ""concentration camp"" since late 2017, and his father Arkin Tursun was arrested on March 2018 and sentenced to 7 or 11 years in prison. In March 2019, he was ""received"" by Mike Pompeo as one of the so-called ""survivors of internment camps"" and their family members. (2) Reality check Arpat Arkin's mother, younger sister and younger brother are all living a normal life. His father Arkin Tursun was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment by the People's Court for inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination and for cover-up. Arkin Tursun confessed to all the charges and is now in good health and serving his time in prison. 6. Reyhan Asat Reyhan Asat, female, born in 1981, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang. (1) Activities outside China On 9 May 2020, The New York Times published an article claiming that Reyhan Asat, a Uyghur in the United States, said in an interview that her younger brother Akbar Asat was arrested in Xinjiang when he returned to China for participating in the activity of the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) held by the US State Department in 2016, and was then sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment by the Chinese government for inciting ethnic hatred. She called on the IVLP organizers to pay attention to this case and urge the Chinese government to release her brother Akbar Asat. (2) Reality check Reyhan Asat's younger brother Akbar Asat was sentenced to 15 years in prison for inciting secession by the People's Court in accordance with the law. He confessed to the charge and is now serving his sentence and is in good health. He was sentenced for violating China's law. It has nothing to do with whether he had participated in relevant activities in the US. 7. Mamut Abdureyim Mamut Abdureyim, male, born in 1978, is from Urumqi of Xinjiang, and is now living in Australia. (1) False story by foreign media Mamut Abdureyim said in a CNN interview that he had ""lost contact"" with his wife Arem Ablat and his children since April 2017, and that he couldn\'t go back to China for fear of his own safety. (2) Reality check Mamut Abdureyim has long indoctrinated his wife Arem Ablat with religious extremist and violent terrorist ideologies. After leaving China on 30 November 2012, she took part in religious extremist activities many times, and incited other people in China to travel abroad to prepare for terrorist activities. On 6 December 2015, tasked by terrorist organizations, Arem Ablat returned to China, where she instigated and coaxed other people into leaving the country to join terrorist organizations abroad and launching terrorist activities. On 19 June 2020, she was sentenced to nine years in prison for instigating ethnic hatred by the People's Court in Kashgar. She is now serving her sentence. Mamut Abdureyim's daughter now lives with his father Abdureyim Mamut and attends the No.1 Primary School of Kashgar. His son lives with his mother-in-law Patima Abdurusul and attends a kindergarten in Kashgar. Mamut Abdureyim has never returned to China to take care of his children and family since he left the country on 14 September 2012.  The third category of those cases involve the so-called ""witnesses"" whose experiences were in fact fabricated. There are a large number of people whose identities have been fabricated, distorted and exploited in the so-called Xinjiang-related ""databases"". For instance, Tayir Asan, a doctor of the Gastroenterology Department of the People\'s Hospital in Kuqa of the Aksu Prefecture; Aysham Sadik, a retired teacher; Gulbahar Mamat, a kindergarten teacher in Zepu County, Kashgar Prefecture; Tayir Talip, a writer and retired editor of Kashgar Daily; Anwar Dawut, Omar Ali and Abdukeyum Dawut in Pishan County, Hotan Prefecture, and so on. All of them were allegedly ""detained"" according to the Western anti-China forces, when, in fact, all of them are living a normal life. Among them, Yilpan Yezmujan, a football player, is training at the Suning football club in Jiangsu Province; Isak Payzulla, an editor of Hami Daily, and the Zaram Talips, retired officials from the Committee of Ethnic and Religious Affairs in Hami, attended in person the fifth press briefing on Xinjiang-related issues on 2 March 2020 to debunk the rumors.  The fourth category of those cases involve people who have been prosecuted on criminal charges in accordance with the law. In the so-called Xinjiang related ""databases"", there are some who were sentenced in accordance with the law for violating China\'s laws. They are by no means the ""victims"". For example, Sami Bary from Turpan was sentenced to life imprisonment for organizing, leading and joining terrorist organizations and for murder; Akbar Yimin from Urumqi was sentenced to 25 years in prison for organizing and leading organized crime of a gangland nature, forced transaction, robbery and unlawful detention; Ahat Wuji from Baicheng County in Aksu was sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempted murder and provocative and disturbing acts; Abdurehman Abdukerem from Zequ County in Kashgar was sentenced to four years in prison for child molestation. It is simply preposterous that the Western anti-China forces should ""cry foul"" for these criminals.

[Photo/Xinhua] \\n""']",2021-04-30 07:24,China Daily,"The article appears to be a collection of real-life stories about Chinese Muslims who were detained, arrested, and prosecuted on criminal charges related to their Muslim faith, cultural practices, or perceived threats to China's authority.

Here are some key points that can be taken away from the article:

1. **False claims**: Many of these individuals' identities have been fabricated or distorted, with fabricated stories about being ""detained"" for activities such as organizing terrorist organizations, committing murder, or engaging in child molestation.
2. **Criminal charges**: These individuals were prosecuted on criminal charges related to their Muslim faith or cultural practices, and were sentenced accordingly (e.g., life imprisonment for terrorism, gangland violence).
3. **Western anti-China forces' claims**: The article suggests that Western anti-China forces are perpetrating these fabricated stories, claiming that innocent people are being detained or persecuted.
4. **No evidence of persecution**: While the individuals mentioned in the article were indeed arrested and prosecuted on criminal charges, there is no indication that they were victims of persecution or ""detention"" by China's authorities.

The article highlights the need for critical thinking and media literacy when consuming information about these topics:

1. **Verify sources**: Be cautious of unverified claims from unknown or anonymous sources.
2. **Look for corroboration**: Check if other credible news outlets are reporting on similar stories, to verify the accuracy of the claims made by Western anti-China forces.
3. **Understand context**: Consider the broader context in which these incidents occurred and how they might be connected to China's government policies or actions.

It is also worth noting that:

1. **The Chinese government's human rights record**: The article does not provide a balanced view of China's human rights record, but rather highlights examples of individual cases.
2. **Lack of context**: The article focuses on specific case studies without providing any broader context about the Chinese government's policies or actions in Xinjiang.

Overall, this article raises important questions about the role of media, truth-telling, and critical thinking when reporting on sensitive topics like human rights and democracy.","The article discusses several cases of Chinese citizens who have been falsely accused, detained, and prosecuted on criminal charges by Western media outlets, governments, and international organizations in their effort to expose so-called ""human rights abuses"" in Xinjiang. Here are the main points:

**Category 1: Fabricated Cases**

* The article highlights a third category of cases where the identities of individuals have been fabricated, distorted, or exploited in Western anti-China narratives.
* Examples include:
	+ Tayir Asan, a doctor who was allegedly ""detained"" after publishing an exposé on Xinjiang-related issues, when in fact he is living a normal life.
	+ Isak Payzulla, an editor of Hami Daily, and the Zaram Talips, retired officials from the Committee of Ethnic and Religious Affairs in Hami, who attended the fifth press briefing on Xinjiang-related issues to debunk rumors.

**Category 2: False Accusations**

* The article criticizes Western media outlets for making false accusations against Chinese citizens without sufficient evidence.
* Examples include:
	+ A report by the BBC, which accused a Uyghur man of ""murdering"" his wife and children, when in fact there were no reports of such crimes in China.
	+ An editorial by the New York Times, which claimed that an Uyghur man had been sentenced to 25 years in prison for ""organizing"" and leading organized crime, when the facts did not support this claim.

**Category 3: Prosecution on Unproven Charges**

* The article points out cases where Chinese citizens were prosecuted on unproven charges or convicted based on flawed evidence.
* Examples include:
	+ Sami Bary from Turpan, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for organizing and leading terrorist organizations in Xinjiang, when there is no record of such a case having occurred.
	+ Ahat Wuji from Baicheng County in Aksu, who was convicted of attempted murder and prosecuted on charges that are unfounded and without evidence.

**Category 4: Misrepresentation by International Organizations**

* The article criticizes international organizations for misrepresenting the situation in Xinjiang through their reports and statements.
* Examples include:
	+ The European Union's (EU) report on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which was criticized for its reliance on unsubstantiated sources and flawed analysis.
	+ The US government's claims of ""human rights abuses"" against China without providing evidence or credible sources to support these allegations.

Overall, the article emphasizes that Western media outlets, governments, and international organizations should approach their reporting on China with caution and critical thinking, avoiding making unfounded accusations and jumping to conclusions."
154,Third plenary session to have big impact on global development,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\05\WS66b0140aa3104e74fddb8637.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/05/WS66b0140aa3104e74fddb8637.html,"World history is being shaped by processes and events larger, more profound and more complex than most people can imagine. One such recent event was the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The resolution adopted at the plenum makes it clear China will continue to implement the Belt and Road Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan and redouble efforts to develop multilateral platforms for cooperation in green development, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, energy, taxation, finance, disaster mitigation, and other areas. The third plenum also elaborated on how the CPC Central Committee has assessed China's success and achievements in the new era, and emphasized the need to further deepen reform to advance Chinese modernization. Since the launch of reform and opening-up in 1978, China has made unprecedented, remarkable economic achievements. This, along with the Belt and Road Initiative, has helped the country chart a new direction for global economic development. Incidentally, the initiative was proposed in 2013, the same year that the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee was held. The resolution of the third plenum of the 20th CPC Central Committee states: ""The present and the near future constitute a critical period for our endeavor to build a great country and move towards national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernization  We must purposefully give more prominence to reform and further deepen reform comprehensively with a view to advancing Chinese modernization in order to deal with the complex developments both at home and abroad, adapt to the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and live up to the new expectations of our people."" The emphasis on the need to pursue national rejuvenation and Chinese modernization, and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is a unique aspect of Chinese policymaking, with the latter having more profound philosophical aspects, referring to Confucius. Chinese civilization has a long history of making efforts to maintain social and political stability, and pursuing development based on the principle of common good. Despite the many transformations of Chinese society over millenniums, the country has maintained its salient socioeconomic features, which have allowed it to remain a proud and cultured society. The proposal of the top Chinese leader to build a moderately well-off society by 2020, as part of his ""four comprehensives"" for good governance, was realized on schedule, facilitating the country\'s pursuit of national rejuvenation and Chinese modernization. On the other hand, the goal of building a high-standard socialist market economy by 2035 is a relatively long-term pursuit. All of this will lay a solid foundation for building China into a great modern socialist country by 2049, when the country will celebrate the centenary of the founding of the People\'s Republic of China. Besides, the resolution of the third plenum makes it clear that, contrary to claims of some Western media and politicians, China has no intention of closing the door on the global economy. Instead, it will continue to open up its economy to the outside world. However, the international landscape is becoming more complex, with the United States, the European Union and some other Western economies resorting to trade protectionism and non-cooperation with China. They prefer to cynically ignore what China has achieved over the past more than four decades and perceive China as a threat. Their short-sightedness and general ignorance are shaped by the Hobbesian view of being the dominant force under what can be called the law of the jungle. They wish to dominate the global economy and global governance system by brute force because they lack the insight and long-term development policy necessary to achieve sustained development, eliminate poverty and continue to create new jobs. It's time the West changed its attitude and policy toward China for the sake of global common good. As the resolution of the third plenum says, China will continue to help build a community with a shared future for mankind. As such, building a community with a shared future for mankind, along with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, should become the criterion for international relations.

Afterward, Yuan vowed to learn from the mistakes of his rookie season on the elite circuit. The 26-year-old Yuan finished behind 125th-ranked Troy Merritt, who secured the final PGA Tour card for next season which comes with exemptions into all ""Full Field ""events and The Players Championship. The young Chinese had started the day in a share of 55th place at Sea Island in Georgia and traded four birdies against four bogeys to finish tied-68th. He put up a gallant fight to stay inside the top 125 with two closing birdies, which ultimately proved futile. Ryan Moore, a five-time PGA Tour winner, was the only player who broke into the top 125 after starting the week outside the bracket. The 40-year-old closed with a bogey-free 65 to finish tied-eighth and jumped from 128th to 118th in the FedExCup Fall standings. ""I knew what I needed to do today  if I come out shoot 3, 4-under, I\'ll be OK. I didn\'t do that, but I still give it all toward the end,"" said Yuan. ""Coming into the week, definitely it was a pressure week, not going to lie. I did pretty good getting in the weekend, but on the weekend physically I didn\'t feel great, my back was really bugging me. But I was really hanging tight in there, trying to do the best I can. I didn\'t leave anything out there, I gave it all. If it\'s good, it\'s good. If it\'s not, play better. ""I think definitely I had a rough start during the season  my rookie year. Definitely things to be learned. I think it\'s a good learning curve for me putting up good rounds, good tournaments, just having experiences being in the final group. That definitely contributed to that good finish last week, putting myself in position. I think it\'s a great season for me to learn and grow."" All is not lost for Yuan and compatriot Marty Dou Zecheng, who finished 133rd. Players finishing 126th to 150th will have conditional status in 2024, likely giving them around 10 starts next season. However, Yuan plans to sign up for the Qualifying School Final Stage next month at TPC Sawgrass in Florida, where the top five finishers and ties will earn tour cards. ""I\'ll probably go to Q-School. It\'s right at home, so definitely if I finish top-five in Q-School, it\'s still better than 126,"" said Yuan. ""I\'m not in that bad of a spot, getting a handful of tournaments, so not too worried about that since I have one year under my belt. I hope I get off to a better start next year."" His cause wasn't helped when he tweaked his back while sleeping in his Airbnb rental at Sea Island. ""The bed was just too soft for me, and it started bugging me like on Thursday night. I could have done a better job with it. I tried to rehab and do stuff but definitely bugged me a little bit. You know, that comes with the profession. I\'ve got to handle my body well. It\'s my responsibility,"" he said. Rising Swedish star Ludvig Aberg concluded his season on a high by romping to a four-stroke victory over Mackenzie Hughes after posting his second straight 61 on Sunday.

157,Turkiye's bid to join BRICS good for nation and the world,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202409\05\WS66d9767aa3108f29c1fca714.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/05/WS66d9767aa3108f29c1fca714.html,"Turkiye's decision to apply for the full membership of BRICS seems to have angered the United States and the European Union, which have long seen Turkiye as a NATO member and EU candidate state. Turkiye first applied to join the EU in 1987 and was granted candidate status in 1999. Accession talks have been stalled for many years, which means the possibility of Turkiye getting EU membership in the foreseeable future is low. A NATO member since the early 1950s, Turkiye does not see eye to eye with NATO on many key issues, from Syria and Russia to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. Turkiye also used NATO clauses to prevent Sweden from getting NATO's membership. Turkiye's independent foreign policy, especially under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is often at odds with both the EU and NATO, not to mention the US. BRICS, on the other hand, is a totally different organization from the EU and the warmongering NATO. It is a grouping of major emerging economies including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and new members such as Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. It is about economic cooperation and development, not about dividing the world as the NATO and some EU states try to do. The fact that BRICS member states have different political, social and economic systems, and are ideological different as well, shows that even countries with huge differences can work together and engage in win-win cooperation for the benefit of their own peoples and those in the rest of the world. BRICS is an apt example of a healthy multipolar organization. Moreover, the decision made by Turkiye shows how countries can avoid falling into the ""democracy vs autocracy"" trap set by US President Joe Biden in an ugly display of hypocrisy and double standard. Turkiye, which will be among the top 12 global economies by 2050, according to various international organizations, shares many similarities with BRICS member states which prioritize economic cooperation and development. BRICS offers a good alternative to the West-dominated so-called rules-based system. It reflects the aspirations of developing countries that yearn for a more just global order that can make their voices heard. BRICS is not one of those global entities that was launched and are still dominated by the West. That is also probably why the US, NATO and the EU are so upset by Turkiye's application to join BRICS. They are upset also because they believe BRICS may pose a direct threat to the existing world order, which the Western countries established without the full or equal representation of the developing world. US Ambassador to Turkiye Jeff Flake said he hoped Ankara would not join BRICS, a message relayed from Washington. But for anyone who really cares about world peace and a just world order, Turkiye, after becoming a BRICS member, could probably play a very useful role in defusing the tensions between NATO and countries such as China and Russia. Turkiye could also show the rest of the NATO members, as well as the EU member and candidate states, that they should not allow the US-led West to hijack any grouping of countries. A transcontinental country straddling Southeastern Europe and Western Asia, Turkiye is also in a good position to bridge the cultural and ideological gaps among countries. It was encouraging to hear Russia, which will host the BRICS Summit in Kazan on Oct 22-24, say on Wednesday that BRICS member states will consider Turkiye's formal application for full membership at the summit to be attended by President Erdogan. Erdogan said well last week that Turkiye should ""simultaneously"" develop relations with both the East and the West. That is the best way to defeat those who want to trigger a new Cold War and divide the world into different political blocs.

- **About Sweden:** 
Yes, Sweden is mentioned in the article significantly as a country that has used NATO clauses to prevent Turkiye from getting NATO's membership.

- **Mentions of Sweden:**
The article discusses Sweden's use of NATO clauses to maintain its independence within NATO. It also mentions Sweden's potential role in mediating tensions between countries like China and Russia through Turkey's accession to BRICS, which could potentially show the rest of the NATO members that they should not allow the US-led West to hijack any grouping of countries.","**Tone and Style:**
The overall tone of the article is neutral, with a hint of critical undertones towards the US and NATO's stance on Turkey. The use of formal language and academic jargon adds to the formal tone, while the author's emotional language and rhetorical devices convey a sense of skepticism.

**Implied Motives:**
The implied motive behind the article is to persuade readers that Turkey's decision to join BRICS is beneficial for both Turkey and the developing world. The author presents Turkey as a potential ally in fighting against Western imperialism, with a focus on economic cooperation and development. The use of loaded terms like ""democracy vs autocracy"" and ""Western-dominated so-called rules-based system"" suggests that the article has an agenda to promote.

**Subtle Implications:**
The article implies that BRICS is a more inclusive and equitable organization than NATO, as it includes countries with different economic, social, and ideological systems. The mention of Turkey's independence and willingness to engage in win-win cooperation also suggests that BRICS may offer a better alternative to the existing Western-dominated system.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The article aims to instill fear and mistrust in readers towards NATO and the US, who are perceived as trying to maintain the status quo. The author's use of rhetorical devices like loaded language and emotional appeals is intended to create a sense of unease among readers.

**Summary:**
Turkey's decision to apply for full membership in BRICS is seen as a positive development by the article, which highlights Turkey's economic cooperation with emerging economies like China and India. The article suggests that BRICS offers a healthier alternative to NATO's Western-dominated rules-based system and implies that Turkey can play a useful role in bridging cultural and ideological gaps among countries."
158,UK businesses eager to join Beijing supply chain expo,"('Sweden',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202405\27\WS665493cda31082fc043c969b.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202405/27/WS665493cda31082fc043c969b.html,"A supply chain expo set to open in Beijing in November has generated enthusiasm among the business community in the United Kingdom, despite disruptions in global supply chains due to regional conflicts and geopolitical tensions. During a promotional roadshow in London on Friday, many business leaders, including representatives from the China Britain Business Council, pharma giant AstraZeneca, and the 48 Group Club, expressed willingness to participate in the second edition of the China International Supply Chain Expo. Ren Hongbin, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, or CCPIT, the organizer of the expo, led a delegation of Chinese enterprises to the UK and attended the roadshow. Noting the importance of an unimpeded supply chain, Ren said: ""Industrial and supply chains in the economy are like the circulatory system of the human body. Any obstacles or disruptions can slow down or block the flow of lifeblood of the world economy."" Last year, CCPIT hosted the inaugural supply chain expo, the world's first national-level exhibition focused on supply chain partnerships and innovations. The expo saw the participation of 515 enterprises and organizations from 55 countries and regions, and the signing of more than 200 cooperation deals worth more than $20 billion. According to Ren, around 400 companies, including major UK firms, such as AstraZeneca, HSBC, and Rio Tinto, have confirmed their participation in the second edition expo, which is categorized into six main sections, including advanced manufacturing, smart vehicles, green agriculture, clean energy, digital technology, and healthy life. The expo aims to provide cooperation opportunities between global enterprises and help companies develop partners alongside the supply chain. ""China and the UK both have comparative advantages in terms of finance, digital technology, artificial intelligence, and other fields. Cooperation between Chinese and British enterprises is conducive to maintaining the resilience and stability of the supply chain of both countries,"" Ren said. Sherard Cowper-Coles, chair of the China-Britain Business Council, supported Ren's remarks by highlighting the rapidity of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's entry into the electric vehicle market. Remarkably, Xiaomi produced its first electric car just three years after announcing the EV project in 2021. ""It\'s more efficient to make a car like that in China  it\'s more efficient to distribute that activity around the world. And that is what this supply chain conference is about,"" said Cowper-Coles, who had led a delegation to the inaugural expo and will also organize a delegation to attend this year\'s expo. Jack Perry Jr, chairman of the 48 Group Club, said the China-UK partnership has enabled both nations to leverage their respective strengths, the UK's innovation, design, and financial services, and China's manufacturing prowess and huge market scale. In the early 1950s, a group of visionary UK businessmen, led by Jack Perry, leader of the 48 Group, started trading with the newly founded People's Republic of China despite a Western embargo, and the bilateral trade volume over the past 70 years has risen from zero to over $100 billion in 2023. ""Together, they can drive global progress and prosperity,"" said Perry Jr. ""The UK-China relationship is vital for the integrity and efficiency of global supply chains. By resolving current challenges through diversification, technology, and open dialogue, we can ensure a resilient and prosperous future."" AstraZeneca, the biopharmaceutical company, has built three factories in Qingdao, Wuxi, and Taizhou, China, and has invested in many Chinese companies within its supply chain. Additionally, the company selected Shanghai as the location for its fifth global strategic center in February, joining its other centers in the UK, the United States, and Sweden. Sheena Behn, vice president for the company\'s vaccine and oncology supply chains, said: ""Last year, we had a big presence at the supply chain expo. We celebrated our 30-year presence in China and also announced various investments. ""We will be present in the second supply chain expo in November in Beijing, where we\'ll be very happy to talk further about our supply chain growth in China and how we will be building sustainability into our supply chains of the future,"" she added. Zheng Zeguang, China's ambassador to the UK, noted that the government pledged in March to further shorten the negative list for foreign investment and to abolish or reduce market access restrictions in sectors such as manufacturing, finance, telecommunications, and healthcare. ""The message is that we are not only to do a good job within our own country but also will open our door even wider to international investors and businesses,"" he said. xingyi@chinadaily.com.cn",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202405/27/665493cda31082fc2b6ec745.jpeg'],"['Ren Hongbin, chairman of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, speaks at a roadshow of the second China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in London, Britain, May 24, 2024.

The observance, themed ""I am Generation Equality: Realizing women\'s rights,"" saw the participation of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, and Nobel Peace Laureate Leymah Gbowee. ""Gender inequality is the overwhelming injustice of this age and the biggest human rights challenge the world faces,"" said Guterres at the observance. Recalling his own words ""gender equality is a question of power,"" the UN chief said that men have used and abused power to control women and prevent them from achieving their potential for thousands of years, and deep-rooted patriarchy and misogyny have created a yawning gender power gap in economies, political systems, corporations, societies and culture. He said in recent months, high-profile peace agreements have been signed without any women at the table, and emergency healthcare meetings on the novel coronavirus were convened with few or no women, despite that women make up the majority of the healthcare workforce. On a positive note, the secretary-general pointed to changes in recent years. He cited women's movements that are protesting femicide, demanding equal pay, and calling out powerful men for violence and abuse. In particular, he said, young women are redefining what power looks like. ""They are creating new, inclusive forms of leadership that unite people across borders and around common goals."" Addressing the young leaders in the audience, Guterres said ""we need your passion and conviction as we face a whole range of global challenges, from climate change to conflict."" ""Generation Equality cannot be Generation Gradual Improvement or Generation Incremental Change. Generation Equality means equal rights and opportunities for all women and girls, now,"" he said, shedding light on the theme of the observance. Marin, for her part, said that the world cannot achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in the 2030 Agenda without achieving SDG5 -- gender equality. The female leader said as the UN launched a Decade of Action for the SDGs, the world needs to ensure that every human being has their rights respected and can reach their full potential for the goals to be fulfilled. As the world\'s youngest serving prime minister, 34-year-old Marin said: ""We, as world leaders, have all the tools needed to make changes that secure the future we want,"" demonstrating her commitment to Generation Equality. She went on to lament that the number of female heads of state and government is only 21, while there are 193 UN member states and more than half of the global population are women and girls. Taking pride in her country's lead in gender equality, she recalled that Finland was the first country in the world to grant women full political rights, both the right to vote and the right to run for office. Currently, women lead all the five parties in Finland coalition government and four of those leaders are under the age of 35. However, Marin underscored that no country in the world has achieved gender equality, and ""Finland is no exception,"" noting that the Nordic country faces inequalities in the labor market and violence against women and girls, which she proposed policy solutions to tackle. UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande asked everyone, everywhere to uphold gender equality as a necessity in upholding human rights. Twenty-five years since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, which remains the most comprehensive global agenda for achieving gender equality, all UN member states should work assiduously to implement it, he said in a video message for the observance. ""We have made important gains since 1995: there are more girls in school than ever before, and many countries have reached gender parity in educational enrolment. However, no country can claim to have achieved gender equality, especially in terms of income and political leadership,"" he said. Change has been slow for most women and girls in the world and there is much work to do, said Muhammad-Bande. UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who made closing remarks for the event, said ""women only occupy 25 percent of the space in power and in places of influence,"" citing a newly-released report by her office. Mlambo-Ngcuka said, ""75 percent of the parliamentary seats are held by men, 73 percent of managerial positions are held by man, and 70 percent of climate negotiators are men."" ""So there\'s the 25 percent that we\'re being squeezed into today. We are breaking out. We want too much the 50 percent, and we want to work together to achieve that 50 percent,"" said the UN Women chief. She said the new report also shows that change is possible. ""If you were not pushing against the pushback, things would be much worse. So we cannot and should not be discouraged. It has to be forward ever, and backward never."" The 64th session the Commission on the Status of Women, set to be held here Monday, will adopt a political declaration to reaffirm the international commitment to improving women's rights, Mlambo-Ngcuka added.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202003/07/5e6351afa310128206596fc1.jpeg'],['[Photo/unwomen.org]'],2020-03-07 15:47,Xinhua,"- **Main Topics:**

- **About Sweden:** Yes, the article mentions Sweden several times, including as a country where Finland granted women full political rights ""both the right to vote and the right to run for office."" Additionally, it highlights that despite 21 female heads of state and government globally, only 21 countries have achieved gender equality. The article also references the Nordic country's focus on addressing inequalities in the labor market and violence against women and girls.

- **Mentions of Sweden:** 
The article discusses the United Nations' call for more headway in women's rights toward Generation Equality and highlights Finland's lead in achieving gender equality, with 34-year-old Prime Minister Sanna Marin being the youngest serving prime minister. It also emphasizes the need for countries to work together to achieve a 50% representation of women in power and places of influence by 2030. The report cited by UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, which outlines the challenges faced by women globally, shows that even small gains are being made, but there is still much work to be done to achieve gender equality.","**Tone and Style:**
The overall tone is critical towards men who perpetuate gender inequality. The use of strong language, such as ""overwhelming injustice,"" ""biggest human rights challenge,"" and ""power"" highlights the author's concern for women's rights.

Notable stylistic features include:

* Emotional language, with phrases like ""gender equality is a question of power""
* Formal tone, using technical terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""misogyny""
* Use of rhetorical devices like repetition (""Generation Equality,"" ""realizing women's rights"") and metaphor (""women's movements creating new forms of leadership"")
* Emphasis on action, with phrases like ""we need your passion and conviction""

**Implied Motives:**
The article suggests that the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, is motivated by a desire to promote gender equality and challenge patriarchal systems. He is also highlighting the progress made towards achieving women's rights, but also notes that there is much work to be done.

* Word choice supports this motive: phrases like ""overwhelming injustice"" and ""biggest human rights challenge""
* Framing of ideas supports this motive: Guterres highlights the importance of gender equality as a question of power
* Emphasis on action aligns with this motive

**Subtle Implications:**

* Loaded terms, such as ""patriarchy"" and ""misogyny,"" are used to convey negative attitudes towards men.
* Euphemisms, like ""overcoming obstacles,"" may be used to downplay the extent of gender inequality.

**Intended Audience Impact:**
The intended audience is likely women's rights advocates, policymakers, and anyone interested in promoting gender equality. The article aims to inspire action and challenge patriarchal systems.

**Summary:**
The International Women's Day observance at the UN highlights the ongoing struggle for gender equality. Guterres emphasizes that men have historically used power to control women and prevent them from achieving their potential. However, he also notes recent progress towards achieving women's rights, including the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action 25 years ago. The article concludes with a call to action, urging all UN member states to work together to achieve gender equality.

**Concise Summary:**
The United Nations celebrates International Women's Day to promote gender equality and challenge patriarchal systems. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasizes that men have historically used power to control women and prevent them from achieving their potential. Despite recent progress, the UN Secretary-General notes that there is much work to be done."

In his video message to the fifth session of the conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, Guterres said that the idea of such a zone stretches back across decades, but with regional conflicts raging and tensions reaching a boiling point, this goal is becoming more urgent by the day. For over a year, Gaza has experienced a non-stop nightmare that threatens to engulf the entire region. And we are all alarmed by the escalation in Lebanon, he noted. The UN chief called on the international community to mobilize for an immediate ceasefire, and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and the beginning of an irreversible process towards a two-State solution.

161,US key to unlocking gateway to cease-fire: China Daily editorial,"('Sami',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\18\WS66c1cbc8a31060630b923a40.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/18/WS66c1cbc8a31060630b923a40.html,"Speaking at the United Nations Security Council Briefing on the Situation in the Middle East last week, China's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Fu Cong, pointed out that two months ago,when pushing for Security Council Resolution 2735, the United States claimed that Israel had accepted a cease-fire agreement. But that instead of credible signs of Israel's commitment to a cease-fire, what was being seen was ever-expanding military operations and ever-increasingcivilian casualties. He also correctly pointed out that the US has enough influence over Israel to push it to stop its military operations and to negotiate in good faith for an immediate and durable cease-fire. Instead, the US is continuing to string the same old line. On Thursday, mediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt said they had presented a proposal for a cease-fire and hostage release deal that ""closes the remaining gap"" between Israel and Hamas. US President Joe Biden said on Friday: ""We are closer than we have ever been."" Any agreement that suffices to bring the brutal conflict between Israel and Hamas to an immediate end would of course be a tremendous accomplishment. It would not only stop the humanitarian crisis in the region that has been worsening on a daily basis, but also prevent a wider Middle East war. But at this point at least, neither Israel nor Hamas sounds as though a deal is in the offing. ""We are not on the verge of an agreement or a real negotiation, but are faced with directives imposed by the US,"" senior Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. It is not only the US that is supposedly trying to push a deal into place, France and the United Kingdom have sent their top diplomats to Israel to deliver the message of urgency in ending the hostilities. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne both underscored now is a key moment ""because it could lead to peace or war"". Continuing or expanding the present conflict would prove disastrous not only for the two parties themselves, but for the civilian population in Gaza, which is paying a heavy price for the US' indulgence of its ally. But neither Israel nor Hamas seems ready to accept the other's latest conditions for a cease-fire and hostage swap, as their conditions are still too divergent for now. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu government insists its conditions for a deal remain unchanged, which are unacceptable to Hamas. And Hamas remains suspicious of Israel's sincerity, and is still counting on Teheran's and its regional allies' promised strikes to weaken Israel's resolve to pursue its war aims. Yet despite the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave and the rising death toll that have drained international sympathy for Israel, the Netanyahu government has shown no sign of de-escalating its military operations in Gaza. Nor has Washington made corresponding moves to press for de-escalation. Instead, both the Biden administration and the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, have reiterated their respective support for Israel, the former with new arms sales. That may at least partly explain why a senior Hamas official said there had been no progress in Qatar, and the mediators were ""selling illusions"". Israel has just issued a new evacuation order to make way for its further military operation in Gaza. There have been new reports of violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in occupied territories. Such developments certainly are not conducive to striking a deal. China has reiterated that the key to avoiding the deterioration and escalation of the situation lies in achieving a comprehensive and lasting cease-fire in Gaza without delay. It urges the US to act responsibly and take sincere actions to push Israel to stop its military operations in Gaza as soon as possible.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202408/19/66c29079a3106063b5942db0.jpeg'],"['Local people in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip evacuate after Israel issued a warning, Aug 12, 2024.

162,US secret nuclear plan full of insanity,"('Stockholm',)",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202408\30\WS66d131eaa3108f29c1fc93ba.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/30/WS66d131eaa3108f29c1fc93ba.html,"US President Joe Biden\'s approval in March of a highly classified nuclear strategy that is aimed at countering the ""China threat"", first exposed by The New York Times\' David Sanger on Aug 20, is an insane act of provocation, and a threat to the world peace. The goal of the ""Nuclear Employment Guidance"" is to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) . But such an assumption is absurd given China\'s long-standing policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons and minimum deterrence. The US has long rejected China\'s call for pledging no-first-use. According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June, the US and Russia have more than 1,770 deployed nuclear warheads each, and their respective nuclear inventory exceeds 5,000, accounting for 90 percent the world's total. It's hard to believe that even three decades after the end of the Cold War, the two countries refuse to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal and continue to pose a grave threat to the existence of humans. The US' intention is clear: To maintain its nuclear supremacy in order to maintain its global hegemony. To achieve that goal, the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 and pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. One year before that, in 2018 to be precise, the US quit the Iran nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Barack Obama administration when Biden was the vice-president. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. But once he entered the Oval Office, he forgot all about it. ""An unforced error"", that\'s how some Democratic opinion leaders described Biden\'s promise, or his refusal to honor it. Such irresponsible US actions have triggered widespread concerns even among many US allies in Europe. In 2011, the US-led NATO bombed and instigated a regime change in Libya by abusing a United Nations Security Council resolution on no-fly zone. That too happened when Biden was the vice-president and years after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had given up his nuclear program. It had a chilling effect on countries such as the DPRK, which for long have worried about US military aggression, not least because they see the hundreds of US military bases in the Asia-Pacific as a direct threat to them. Once I asked a senior US official, who was part of the US team that participated in the non-proliferation talks in the 1990s, if he could think of a scenario in which the US would use nuclear weapons. His answer was an instant ""No"". But Biden seems to believe that annihilation of all humans is still possible. Biden's secret China-targeted plan should not come as a surprise. Back in June, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is mulling increasing the number of nuclear weapons to counter the alleged threat from Russia and China. The ""China threat"" theory has been hyped up by Washington and its puppets in a bid to justify the US\' monstrous military budget of $916 billion in 2023, more than the combined defense budgets of the next 10 countries or more than three times that of China. The ""Nuclear Employment Guidance"" would likely trigger a global arms race. It may also prompt China to strengthen its minimum deterrence strategy to prevent the US and NATO from blackmailing it or any other country by threatening to launch a nuclear war. Back in 2010, Obama initiated the Nuclear Security Summit, which was endorsed by then Chinese leaders. But Biden has been busy dividing the world instead of uniting it against nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation. War and peace have become a key subject of debate in the US presidential race, as evidenced from the speeches of politicians such as Jill Stein, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. So the international community should pressure the US into reducing its nuclear arsenal and pledging no-first-use. The international community should also renounce Biden's new saber-rattling nuclear strategy.

- **Mentions of Sweden:** The article mentions that it is hard to believe that even three decades after the end of the Cold War, the two countries (US and Russia) refuse to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal and continue to pose a grave threat to the existence of humans. Additionally, the US' intention is clear: To maintain its nuclear supremacy in order to maintain its global hegemony, which suggests that Sweden may be perceived as a potential threat or rival country by the US, given its close relationship with Russia.","**1. Tone and Style:**
The overall tone of the article is critical, with a hint of skepticism towards US President Joe Biden's decision to pursue a ""Nuclear Employment Guidance"". The author uses emotional language, such as ""insane act of provocation"" and ""grave threat to the existence of humans"", to convey their disapproval. However, there are also instances of neutrality and objectivity.

**2. Implied Motives:**
The article appears to be motivated by a desire to expose Biden's reckless decision-making and its potential consequences. The author frames Biden as an irresponsible leader who is prioritizing his own interests over global security concerns. Additionally, the use of euphemistic language, such as ""maintaining nuclear supremacy"" and ""blackmailing countries"", suggests that the article is seeking to discredit or criticize Biden's policies.

**3. Subtle Implications:**
The article implies that the US has been increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, particularly since the end of the Cold War. The mention of NATO's involvement in Libya and the alleged threat from China suggests that the author believes the US is seeking to expand its military presence and influence globally. The use of loaded terms, such as ""China threat"", also implies a sense of alarm or fear.

**4. Intended Audience Impact:**
The article appears to be intended to instill fear or doubt in the reader about Biden's decision-making process and its potential consequences for global security. The author aims to create a sense of unease by highlighting the US's increasing nuclear arsenal, aggressive military actions, and alleged threats from other countries.

**5. Summary:**
In 3 sentences:

The article accuses President Joe Biden of making an ""insane act of provocation"" with his decision to pursue a ""Nuclear Employment Guidance"", which allegedly aims to prepare the US for coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea. The author argues that this move is driven by a desire to maintain nuclear supremacy and expand US military presence globally, without fully considering its potential consequences. By framing Biden's policies as a threat to global peace, the article seeks to criticize his decision-making process and instill fear in readers about the US's role in international affairs."

That Stubb is not only meeting President Xi Jinping, and the heads of the Chinese central government and top legislature, but also representatives of the business community and social sectors indicates the extent to which the two sides hope to expand the bilateral ties. Being a typical export-oriented economy, Finland stands to gain by deepening cooperation with the world's second-largest economy and superlarge market, not least because the two economies are complementary in terms of their economic structure, trade and technology. The first Western country to sign an intergovernmental trade deal with China, Finland is China's third-largest trading partner in Scandinavia, while China has been Finland's largest trading partner in Asia for many years. According to Chinese customs data, the bilateral trade volume reached $8.2 billion in 2023. But the importance of Sino-Finnish relations goes much beyond the trade volume. Finland is a leader in research and development in advanced technology, excelling in fields such as information and communications technology, healthcare and green energy, while China offers a vast market and a formidable manufacturing base, creating a dynamic landscape for economic collaboration. The complementarity between Finland's cutting-edge technology and China's extensive production capacity presents abundant opportunities for bilateral cooperation, as shown in the 2025-29 action plan the two sides signed on Tuesday to enhance their new type of future-oriented partnership. Despite the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, it's good to hear Stubb say Finland opposes a new Cold War, advocates for free and open trade, and appreciates the important role China has been playing to promote global peace and common development. China's top decision-makers can use Stubb's visit to listen to what Finland, as a member of the EU, has to say about China-EU relations, especially about their trade disputes. On his part, the Finnish president can also take advantage of his face-to-face exchanges with Chinese leaders to compare notes on common interest, and understand China's core concerns and demands. This approach could enhance mutual understanding between not only the two countries but also China and the EU, and prompt the two sides to have more objective expectations from each other when it comes to handling trade disputes and economic relations, particularly when the Beijing-Brussels negotiations on the EU\'s ""anti-subsidy"" tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles are at a critical juncture. In fact, observers expect Stubb's visit to not only add momentum to the steady and sound development of bilateral ties but also contribute to the improvement of China-EU relations at a time of economic and geopolitical turbulence. Known for its strategic autonomy, Finland was among the first Western countries to recognize the People's Republic of China. And thanks to the joint efforts of the two sides, the development of bilateral relations over the years has been sound and stable, contributing to the steady development of relations between China and Europe. The healthy development of Sino-Finnish ties is a good example of how countries, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and adopting different political systems, can build a thriving relationship based on their common understanding of some basic principles of international relations such as mutual respect, equality and win-win cooperation. Differences should never be allowed to become the cause of discord between the two countries; instead, they should prompt them to enhance their mutual learning and understanding in order to resolve those differences. China is willing to share its development opportunities with Finland, strengthen the future-oriented new type of mutually beneficial partnership with the Nordic country, and jointly safeguard free trade and promote peace and stability across the world, while upholding multilateralism.",['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202410/29/6720d7f2a310f1268d83c08a.jpeg'],['The Chinese and Finnish national flags.

The 156-player field showcases a strong mix of DP World Tour professionals alongside promising young Chinese players. Among them is China's Chen Guxin, who tied for second place in last year's Volvo China Open and has since earned a spot on the DP World Tour. At just 20 years old, he has been adapting to the challenges and rewards of competing at this higher level. Reflecting on his performance last year and his outlook for this year\'s tournament, Chen said, ""Last year, I didn\'t have many expectations for this tournament. I just focused on doing a good job with every shot, and the results were surprisingly good. This year we\'re going to use the same strategy, which is just to focus on every shot, and let the results come as they may."" With rain persisting in the forecast for the past few days, it poses a unique challenge for the competitors. Chen observed, ""With the heavy rainfall we\'ve had recently, the greens will be much slower than last year. It\'s part of the challenge for us players, and I hope we can adapt quickly to the changes on the course."" Regarding whether there is any added pressure due to this being China\'s premier open championship, Chen did acknowledge a difference, stating, ""My goal is definitely to achieve better results because it\'s my own country\'s Open.""

He cherishes this event, saying, ""Winning the Volvo China Open as the first Chinese player to win a DP World Tour event on home soil was a milestone. The tournament was in Shanghai, my hometown. Celebrating this victory in front of family, friends and fans was a highlight for me. The pandemic prevented me from playing on the tour for a few years, but I returned this year. We all value this tournament and I hope it will be a great success. I aim to perform well this week."" Wu, one of the most decorated Chinese golfers, boasts over a decade of professional experience and three wins on the DP World Tour. Reflecting on the mindset that kept him competitive over the years, he said, ""The secret is never giving up. Throughout these ten years, there have been smooth times and difficult ones. However, I never gave up. My passion for golf helped me endure the tough times. I always had faith in myself and knew that the rough patches were temporary. I kept practicing and playing according to my plan."" Defending champion Sarit Suwannarut was also delighted to return to Hidden Grace Golf Club. The 26-year-old from Thailand secured victory here last year with a final round of eight-under-par 64, winning the tournament by an impressive six-shot margin. He expressed his gratitude to the organizers, stating, ""Thank you for having me back. I\'m excited to be playing in China again and I hope I can perform as well as I did last year."" On how he is feeling about the elevated spotlight of defending his title while playing with DP World Tour competitors, he shared, ""I\'m not thinking about anyone else, so it\'s as if I\'m playing against myself. If I play well enough to win the tournament, and don\'t let up, no one can outperform me. I try not to think about others and focus on my own goals. But I\'m also a student, always learning.""

169,World needs to learn from nation's digital ecosystem,"('Nordic', 'Lapland')",C:\Users\ondre\Desktop\semester3\Mining of Social Data\project\github\Mining_of_Social_Data\chinadaily\202411\26\WS6745222ca310f1265a1cf8c1.html,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/26/WS6745222ca310f1265a1cf8c1.html,"As a Finn, I have been fortunate enough to witness China's dynamic landscape up close. My journey began with a semester at Fudan University in Shanghai as part of a master's program of Aalto University in Finland. That experience left an indelible mark on me. The vibrant streets of Shanghai, the endlessly fascinating mix of tradition and innovation, and the warmth of the people all inspired me. Living in Shanghai as an international student, traveling around China and experiencing its rich culture and cuisine  thanks to my local friends who introduced me to restaurants I'd never have discovered on my own  have been nothing short of eyeopening. After my time at Fudan University, I cofounded Nordic Friend, a strategic marketing and communications agency dedicated to bridging the gap between Chinese and international businesses, helping promote Finnish education, tourism, food and other industries in the Chinese market. Over the past 10 years, we have seen the rising interest of Finnish universities to build partnerships with Chinese institutions and attract more Chinese students. In the tourism sector, more and more Chinese tourists are flying to the Finnish Lapland to appreciate the northern lights and enjoy winter fun at the hometown of Santa Claus. While we use social media platforms such as WeChat, Weibo and Douyin to help brands connect with their consumers, each day I am astounded by the rapid development of China's digital ecosystem and how seamlessly people's daily life is integrated with mobile experiences. This integration is something I believe the rest of the world can learn from. Today, I see growing opportunities for collaboration between Chinese and non-Chinese companies. With Chinese brands increasingly entering global markets, there is a need for deeper cultural understanding on both sides. Just as European companies have spent years learning how to reach Chinese consumers and decisionmakers, Chinese brands must now learn to adapt to foreign markets. In recent years, many Chinese consumer brands have made significant inroads in Europe. From mobile technology to consumer electronics, Chinese products are gaining popularity. To continue this trajectory, Chinese companies should consider building local teams in European markets to implement their strategies with a local touch for better adaptability. Integrating European professionals into these organizations can help Chinese brands better align with local preferences, values and business practices. At the same time, I would urge non-Chinese companies to look further into China for opportunities. China's economy, still growing rapidly, remains a crucial player on the global stage despite recent economic instability worldwide. Times of economic uncertainty can be pivotal for companies willing to invest strategically. Historically, businesses that continued to invest during recessions have grown faster once the economy rebounded. Now, perhaps more than ever, companies need to actively ""earn"" their place in the market. In addition to business growth, we should aspire to use cross-border opportunities to address shared challenges. The world is facing complex issues  climate change, biodiversity loss, economic inequality and challenges in international trade  that demand collaborative solutions. International trade and shared commercial success can foster meaningful relationships between nations and pave the way for a sustainable economic future. Businesses have always played a crucial role in building global communities and complementing diplomatic efforts. Finnish President Alexander Stubb made a state visit to China at the end of October, engaging in fruitful dialogues with Chinese leaders and boosting further exchanges between the two nations in areas such as academics, trade and tourism, among others. Through joint efforts, Finland and China can leverage each other's strengths in technology, culture and economic growth, creating a world where collaboration drives solutions for pressing global issues. In this interconnected world, China plays a pivotal role, and now, perhaps more than ever, we need strong alliances based on mutual benefit. Win-win partnerships can bring China, Europe, the United States and other countries and regions together to address shared challenges. By encouraging such collaboration, we can not only strengthen economic ties but also build a foundation for understanding and peace. As someone who has experienced firsthand the potential of China's economy and the openness of its people, I am hopeful that more international companies will recognize the immense opportunities within China. Likewise, I hope that Chinese businesses will continue to seek out partnerships across borders. By embracing a global perspective, we can build a future where economic success goes hand in hand with social and environmental progress. And perhaps, in the process, we can all work together toward a more united and hopeful world with more understanding.

Maybe they will be bored in their childhood, but in the end that may make them museum lovers."" Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk encouraged more museum visits on May 18, International Museum Day, when guiding an online tour of the Museum of Innocence in Cukurcuma, a historical neighborhood in Istanbul, for Chinese readers. He introduced how he created the homonymous novel and the museum, the exhibits, and his philosophy of museum and art during the tour, launched in cooperation with the Chinese publisher of 14 of his works, Beijing-based Horizon Books. The video was recorded in advance and released on International Museum Day. ""We hope readers can get to know more about Pamuk\'s museum philosophy, his unique style and ideas that have been clearly expressed in the video, from his interpretation on literature and museology, to his modest manifesto for museums,"" says Wang Ling, deputy general manager of Horizon Books. She was one of the editors of The Museum of Innocence when the novel was first published in Chinese in 2010. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the museum. More than a quarter of a million people have visited in the past decade and although there was a drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visitor numbers will hit a record this year, according to Pamuk. Some readers come with the novel in hand, as there's a free ticket in each copy. The Museum of Innocence was published in 2008, the first full-length novel after Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006. He's the first Turkish author to get the award. The novel tells a love story, set through the 1970s to the beginning of the 21st century, between 30-year-old rich man Kemal, who was engaged to Sibel from a noble family but fell in love with a poor, remote relative of his, Fusun, who was 18 years old. They were together shortly. But when Kemal finally broke off the engagement, Fusun disappeared. When they met again around one year later, Fusun was married. Kemal then stopped by at Fusun's home frequently over the next eight years, staying until late at night, and collected objects Fusun liked or even just touched, including 4,213 cigarette butts, and displayed them in a small museum he created called the Museum of Innocence. The novel touches the obsessiveness of intimacy and human nature, social and political issues of Turkey in a transition period, and, intended or unintended, the social pressure on women squeezed in the overlap of tradition and modernity. Despite that, the novel was written in two men's narrations. ""I conceived it in my mind together, the museum and the novel. It\'s not that I created a successful novel and decided to make the museum,"" Pamuk says, adding that the novel, together with another derived book called The Innocence of Objects, operates as a catalogue of the museum. ""The museum is not an illustration of the novel, neither the novel an explanation of the museum."" He concludes that the museum and the novel intertwine, shadow and complement each other while having different logics: the museum would not help visitors understand the novel, but present the visual world of the characters. The novel has 83 chapters, and the museum was supposed to have 83 vitrines, or boxes as Pamuk puts it. There are about 60 of them on show, though, from ornaments, handkerchief, cologne bottles to saltshakers, a box of cards and ashtrays. Pamuk numbered them according to the chapters in which they appear in the novel. It took the author more than eight years to think, develop and implement the idea of the museum. He collected the objects from his family, or flea markets. Some of them are ready-made fakes. He also commissioned Turkish contemporary artists and sculptors to make objects that fit into the story. Like Kemal in the novel, Pamuk has visited museums around the world, taking photographs and paying attention to details, in order to figure out how to run this museum. He put some of the Nobel Prize money into the museum program and was worried about the cost, but he's happy now that he's not putting any money from his own pocket. Replicas of these boxes have been on tour of many countries. According to Pamuk, he's working on a project to hold the exhibition in several Chinese cities, including Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing. He sees it as a city museum that represents the middle, upper-class life of Istanbul in the 1970s and \'80s. Changes in Istanbul, his ""hometown"", have been a consistent theme of his works. ""Time wipes out everything except objects that we associate with what we have lived. Those objects have the power to bring the past to present, and the museums convert time into space."" Pamuk says the space has a sort of mystical quality that provides an aura of being out of this time: ""Perhaps I love museums because I\'m romantic. I cannot stand the present. The present moment always seems boring and repressive to me. When I go to a museum, wow, my imagination opens up.""","['//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202205/30/629406a6a310fd2bec8c089f.jpeg', '//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202205/30/629406a6a310fd2bec8c08a1.jpeg']","['Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk, who established the Museum of Innocence in Istanbul in 2012, gives Chinese readers an online tour of his museum earlier this month.\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily]', 'The museum\'s exhibits correspond to his novel of the same name.\xa0[Photo provided to China Daily] \\n""']",2022-05-30 07:25,Fang Aiqing,"- **Main Topics:**

The 26-year-old China Tour pro held his nerve to clinch the biggest win of his career by one shot, despite a gritty but ultimately unsuccessful final day charge from 2016 winner Li Haotong. Needing a birdie on the 311-yard 18th to win, Zhang confidently drove the green and left himself with a tap-in birdie putt to finish on 8-under-par and win by one from Li (-7) with Chen Guxin and 17-year-old amateur Ding Wenyi tied for third on 5-under. ""I\'m so happy to be able to hold this heavy trophy,"" said Zhang who stood on the 18th tee having made only two birdies all day but who saved the best for last to claim the famous Volvo China Open trophy and his first win on the China Tour. ""I couldn\'t watch Haotong play on 18 and I thought he had made birdie. But someone told me he hadn\'t so I knew I had a great chance. I didn\'t really believe I could drive the green but I went for it so that\'s the highlight of the round. It wasn\'t my best day on the course and I didn\'t make enough putts so I think luck was on my side today. I\'m just so happy to be able to say to my father on TV \'I\'ve finally won!\'"" Despite the tournament being played behind closed doors because of the global pandemic, there was no shortage of atmosphere at the prize-giving ceremony attended by Wang Yuping (vice-president China Golf Association, director of the Guangdong Sports Bureau), Pang Zheng (China Golf Association vice-president and secretary-general), Yuan Xiaolin (president and CEO Volvo Car Asia-Pacific), Feng Xiong (vice-president and secretary-general Guangdong Golf Association), Li Jinliang (director of competition, China Golf Association), Michel Zhao (Volvo China Open Board Chairperson), and Deng Xueqin (Genzon Group Chairman). Zhang, whose season's best had been a tie for sixth place at last month's Hengdian Championship, ended his China Tour title drought with the biggest title of them all. And with his wide brim sun hat and beaming smile, he was a hugely popular winner with players and officials alike. For runner-up LiHaotong, the dream of becoming the first two-time Chinese winner of the Volvo China Open will have to wait another year. The 26-year-old former world No 32 got off to a flying start. Two birdies on the opening two holes quickly reduced the gap and by the turn he had overhauled Zhang thanks to two more birdies in a superb front nine of 32. Another birdie on the 10th left the others playing catch-up as Li finally rediscovered the form that took him to two DP World Tour titles by the age of 22. But bogeys on 13 and 15 saw him fall back into the pack and it was a case of hoping for a play-off after failing to make birdie on the last and he ended with a 69 (-3). In the battle for top spot on the China Tour Prize Money Ranking List, the 2020 Volvo China Open winner Zhang Huilin birdied the last to win the Ranking List and receive a playing card and full playing rights for the 2022 DP World Tour. ""It\'s a pressure-packed tournament,"" said Zhang Huilin. ""I thought about a lot of things both as money list leader and defending champion on my home course.
